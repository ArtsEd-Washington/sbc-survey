<p>
  As a local control state, Washington schools' success (and budget) are 
  dependent on the school board. Support of arts education is especially
  important now: the passage of SB5878 requires schools with more than 200
  enrolled students to offer arts, visual or performing, each year a student is
  enrolled in K-12 school. This must be taught by a certified art teacher. At
  least one year's credit is a high school graduation requirement. This law
  clarifies the state's position on arts education but the measure is not
  funded. The text of the law can be found above.
</p>
<p>
  Every other year, we survey school board candidates to make sure you can make 
  the most informed vote possible. As a nonprofit, we can't endorse candidates,
  but we can share their views. This year, we asked about personal experiences
  with the arts, plans candidates are willing to consider if elected to ensure
  the arts are supported, how their district will be impacted by SB 5878, and
  how they intend to support culturally responsive and trauma-informed arts.

  To find your candidate's response, just scroll to find your district and click 
  the Educational Service District to see the full survey. (We suggest desktop
  vs mobile for readability.)
</p>

<p>
  This year, we had 94 responses representing 61 school districts, 8 ESDs, and 
  across 25 counties. However, if you don't see your school district
  highlighted, it means we didn't receive any response from candidates in that
  school district.
</p>
<p>Thanks for getting informed and don't forget to vote by November 7th!</p>

  All candidates who provided a valid email address when they registered their 
  campaign have been invited to participate.
