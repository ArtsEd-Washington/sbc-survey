My daughter attended a project-based public high school where she learned the skilled art of stained glass, gaining both material science knowledge and artistic expertise, and now teaches stained glass classes while attending college.

These experiences demonstrate how arts education enriches students’ academic, social, and personal growth, opening doors to future opportunities.

Dedicated educators and community partnerships: Our district benefits from passionate arts teachers and collaborations with local organizations like Spokane Arts and the MAC, which expand access to performances, exhibitions, and mentorship.

Student talent and diversity: From visual arts to music and theater, Spokane students consistently showcase creativity that reflects the district’s cultural richness and resilience.

Integrated arts in some schools: Programs like Ferris High School’s music department and Libby Center’s creative curriculum demonstrate what’s possible when arts are prioritized.

Challenges We Must Address

Equity of access: Not all schools have the same resources—some lack full-time arts educators, instruments, or materials. This creates disparities in opportunity, especially for Title I schools.

Funding instability: Arts programs are often first on the chopping block during budget cuts, despite their proven impact on student engagement, mental health, and academic success.

Limited representation: Curricula and performances don’t always reflect the diverse cultures and identities of our students. We need more inclusive programming that uplifts marginalized voices.

What I Want Voters to Know

I believe arts education is essential—not extracurricular. It’s a core part of how students learn to express themselves, build confidence, and connect across differences. As a candidate for Spokane School Board, I’m committed to:

Advocating for stable, equitable funding for arts across all schools

Supporting inclusive curricula that reflect our students’ lived experiences

Partnering with local artists and organizations to expand access and visibility

Arts aren’t just enrichment—they’re empowerment. And every student deserves that.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","Here’s how arts education fits into that vision:

It’s a driver of equity. When arts programs are accessible across all schools, not just those with extra funding or parent boosters, we create pathways for expression, confidence, and connection that benefit every student, especially those who may not thrive in traditional academic settings.

It’s a tool for inclusion. Arts education allows students to explore identity, culture, and lived experience. That’s especially powerful for neurodivergent students, multilingual learners, and those from historically marginalized communities. I want our district’s arts programming to reflect the full spectrum of who our students are.

It strengthens the community. Whether it’s a school play, a mural project, or a jazz concert, arts events bring families together and build pride in our schools. They’re also opportunities to partner with local artists, cultural organizations, and businesses, something I’ll actively champion as a board member.

It’s part of whole-child learning. My campaign is rooted in the belief that students deserve more than test scores and rigid metrics. Arts education fosters creativity, emotional intelligence, and collaboration, all essential skills for life beyond graduation.

Supporting arts education isn’t a side issue; It’s central to how we build joyful, equitable schools. And I’ll advocate for it with the same urgency I bring to academic achievement, mental health, and labor partnerships."

(Check all that apply.),Visual Art,"How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your life after high school?","I wasn’t especially involved in the arts during school, but I always enjoyed the creative parts of my education — from the dance elements in physical education to the required music classes in elementary school. In middle school, I participated in choir and even took on a leadership role, which helped me grow into a more well-rounded person who continues to appreciate the arts today.

One experience that really stayed with me was learning tinikling in elementary school. We practiced it every year, though our teacher taught us in 4/4 time instead of the traditional 3/4. I loved it so much that years later, when my own children were in elementary school, I helped them create original acts for the annual variety show — including a tinikling routine with a group of eight kids. We kept the 4/4 rhythm and added moves I had never learned as a child. It became a fun and creative way to share culture, rhythm, and even math through dance — and to bring something original and joyful to our school community.","If elected, which of these strategies would you consider implementing?

The arts play a vital role in that effort — offering creative outlets where students can connect, express themselves, and find community. Even more variety shows!

We’re fortunate to have many dedicated arts educators who intentionally include and support students with disabilities, helping ensure that every child can experience the joy and confidence that come from participating in the arts. That kind of inclusion is something I deeply value, as a mom of a now adult with autism. We also have an updated K-5 music curriculum that our educators asked for in 2020.

At the same time, we face real challenges. Some of our elementary schools are so full that art must be taught “on a cart” rather than in a dedicated classroom. This, along with ongoing underfunding of public education, limits what our teachers and students can do. Still, our educators continue to find creative ways to make the arts accessible, and that resilience deserves recognition and support.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","My campaign centers on creating a sense of belonging for students, families, and educators. Arts education is an important part of that — for many students, it’s where they find their voice and community. The arts also help develop well-rounded individuals, and through collaborative creative experiences, students build social-emotional skills that support them far beyond the classroom."

(Check all that apply.),"Music, Theatre, Visual Art","How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your life after high school?","Arts education was a key part of my K-12 education.  The opportunity to take the classes and participate in music helped me develop skills and gain appreciate that have made my life richer every day. Music taught me to work hard, recover from failure, work in a team, follow directions, and find joy in ensemble. High school chorale, band, and theatre were joyous, powerful, challenging experiences for me.  
I started singing in a kid's choir in church and enjoyed band, choir, select groups, and solo performance in middle school and high school. I loved that my friends and I, under the leadership of a skilled musician/teacher, could come together to make incredible music. Individually we practiced to grow our skills to improve the ensemble, worked hard to earn a spot in the select groups, and even harder to compete in festivals. I was in a select singing group that earned a top score at the state competition in 1976. I can still feel the exhilaration and joy we felt making incredible music together. My high school experience instilled a deep appreciate of music that expanded to the visual and theatre in my adult life. Today we support many arts organizations in our community
My experience in theatre provided an individual challenge where I had to overcome the fear of individual performance. I had to face up to not delivering the performance I wanted. This  started my journey to deal with the anxiety of public speaking and performance.  The lessons learned have helped me throughout my career.","If elected, which of these strategies would you consider implementing?

A challenge I see is making sure that all students have equal access to arts opportunities, regardless of which school they attend or their family’s resources. Sometimes, the arts are treated as an “extra,” when in reality they are an essential part of student development and wellbeing.

Music quickly became more than just an extracurricular. It was a way to express myself when words didn’t feel like enough. The arts gave me an outlet to process emotions, communicate in new ways, and connect with others.

Learning music also taught me discipline and built my work ethic. Practicing an instrument requires patience, consistency, and focus—skills that carried over into my academics and continue to serve me in my professional life. Just as importantly, music broadened my perspective. It deepened my understanding of storytelling in film and theater and showed me the value of creative expression as a universal language.

These experiences are why I believe arts education is so vital for students today. Not every student thrives in traditional or “conventional” ways of learning or expressing themselves, but the arts give them a pathway to be seen, heard, and successful.

Budget constraints, staffing shortages, and inequities between schools mean not every student has the same opportunity to participate. Too often, the arts are seen as “extras” instead of essential components of a well-rounded education, and that creates gaps in access.

I want voters to know that I see the arts as vital, not optional. Every student—regardless of which school they attend—deserves the chance to discover their creative voice and the skills the arts build. My perspective is that we need to protect and strengthen arts programming, even in tough budget times, by prioritizing equitable access and seeking creative partnerships with our community to sustain these opportunities for all students.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","Arts education is not separate from my vision for our schools—it’s woven into it. My campaign is about inclusivity, accessibility, accountability, and transparency, and the arts play a critical role in all of those areas. The arts invite every student to participate and succeed in different ways, regardless of background or learning style. They build bridges across differences, create opportunities for collaboration, and help students develop the creativity and resilience they’ll need in life beyond the classroom.

Supporting arts education means making sure every student, in every school, has access to these opportunities—not just those in well-resourced programs or families who can afford private lessons. It also means listening to our educators and community partners about what resources and support they need to keep the arts strong in Olympia.

For me, protecting and strengthening arts education isn’t just about defending “programs.” It’s about ensuring that every student has the chance to discover their own voice, build confidence, and connect to something larger than themselves. By giving students these opportunities now, we’re preparing them to be successful, creative, and engaged members of our community long after they leave the classroom."

The arts have consistently supported my mental health and resilience, offering a creative space to process challenges and connect with others in ways words often cannot.
As an educator and school leader, I have seen firsthand that students engaged in the arts are more successful overall than their peers. Arts education boosts confidence, strengthens academic skills, and deepens engagement in school. When students have access to music, theater, dance, and visual arts, they are more likely to feel connected, express themselves, and thrive both academically and socially.
For me, the arts are not just enrichment—they are essential. They create stronger individuals and stronger communities, and I believe every student deserves access to them.","If elected, which of these strategies would you consider implementing?

Our high schools have vibrant band, choir, and theater programs that bring students together, showcase their talents, and give our community so much to be proud of. These programs are often where students find their voice, their belonging, and their confidence.
But we also face real challenges. At the elementary level, arts programming is far too limited. In fact, even the volunteer-led art docent program has been eliminated. This creates inequities in access and leaves too many students without early opportunities to explore their creativity. We also face ongoing budget pressures that too often put arts programs on the chopping block, even though we know that students engaged in the arts are more successful across the board.
As a candidate, I want voters to know that I see the arts as essential, not optional. Dance, music, visual arts, and theater foster creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. They support student mental health and engagement, and they make schools more joyful and connected places.
If elected, I will advocate for restoring and expanding elementary arts, protecting our thriving secondary programs, and building stronger community partnerships to enrich what we can offer. The arts are a strength worth protecting and a challenge worth solving—because every child deserves access to them.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?

They also strengthen academics, support mental health, and create schools where students feel they belong.
My vision is for every child, at every level, to have access to meaningful arts experiences. That means protecting our strong secondary programs, but also restoring and expanding elementary arts so students can discover their creativity early. It means engaging community partners—artists, cultural organizations, and neighbors—to bring even more opportunities into our schools.
Ultimately, the arts embody what I want for our schools: places where students are known by name, strength, and need, where they thrive academically and socially, and where they are prepared not just for tests, but for life.

One strength unique to Bremerton is the way our arts programs reflect the diverse backgrounds and voices of our community. This helps students see themselves as being valued and represented.

But we also know that at the same time, when the discussion comes around about making cuts to programs (because of budget cuts), it's the arts programs that are often the first areas threatened. This can create inequities in access and limit opportunities for students who may thrive in creative disciplines. I believe the arts are not extras and that they are essential to a well-rounded education. The arts help support academic success, foster problem-solving, and provide healthy outlets for expression.

If elected to the school board, I would continue to advocate for art programs because of the opportunities that can be provided and to ensure that all students can participate. I want the voters to know that I see the arts as an important part of preparing our students not only for college and careers, but also for meaningful lives as engaged, creative members of our community.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","Arts education is an important part of my vision because it embodies what I believe is a place where every student is seen, supported, and given multiple ways to succeed. I understand that there are kids who don't thrive in traditional academics alone and the arts are a way for some kids to discover their voice on stage, their confidence with an instrument, or solving problems by using skills through creative design. I believe when we invest in the arts, we are also investing in the whole child.

My campaign is also built on equity, opportunity, and community connection. Arts programs are a powerful tool that incorporates all three of these. This can level the playing field by allowing every student, regardless of their background, the chance to explore their creativity. This can strengthen opportunities by helping students build skills that are transferable to any career. And they connect our community, because performances, showcases, and exhibits bring families and neighbors into our schools in a meaningful way.

Supporting arts education is not separate from the work of academic improvement or student safety—it complements them. Students who are engaged in the arts show stronger attendance, higher graduation rates, and deeper connections to school. That’s the kind of well-rounded success I want for every Bremerton student."

I want voters to know that when we invest in the arts, we invest in a more equitable, well-rounded education that supports both academic and personal growth.

In building healthy and connected communities, the arts play a powerful role. They bring people together across cultures, generations, and neighborhoods. Arts programs help schools feel welcoming and inclusive, and they give students and families a voice in how their stories are told.

Supporting valued educators means recognizing that arts educators are essential, too. We must ensure they are well-supported, well-compensated, and included in decision-making — just like their colleagues in other subject areas.

And when it comes to purposeful and accountable leadership, I believe arts funding reflects our values. If we say we care about equity, student engagement, and whole-child learning, our budgets need to show it. That means protecting and investing in arts programs.

What’s unique here is that despite these challenges, our students still produce inspiring performances and artwork that show how essential the arts are to learning and belonging.

I want voters to know that I see the arts as core to education, not an “extra.” The arts build confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork, the very skills we want every graduate to have.

For me, supporting arts education means ensuring it is accessible in every school, not just a select few. It means prioritizing funding, staffing, and scheduling that allow students to fully participate in music, theater, and visual arts alongside their core classes.

My campaign is about making sure every student has the best education experience possible, and the arts are a powerful part of that. They prepare students for life after graduation just as much as reading, math, and science and they make schools joyful places to be."

These students rehearse weekly and perform an ambitious schedule of concerts. This level of excellence reflects the district’s commitment to nurturing talent and providing meaningful opportunities for artistic growth.

However, challenges persist. A major issue is access to adequate performance and rehearsal spaces. Local groups like the Issaquah Philharmonic Orchestra face “creative constraints” due to limited space and equipment storage, which can impact the quality and inclusivity of performances 2.

One strength is the quality and scope of Bellevue’s arts offerings, especially in Media & Visual Arts. Students have access to hands on courses in video production, graphic design, technical theater and more in our CTE options. There is also support through grants from PTAs and community partners that enable teachers to bring performances, field trips, and innovative arts projects into classrooms. 
But there are challenges. Budget constraints, rising costs, and underfunded state support are putting pressure on arts enrichment. The district must cut spending in many areas and if the situation worsens, arts programs may face cuts or reduced resources. Also, there can be inequality in access since some schools may have more resources (e.g. more PTA funding) than others or charge access fees, which means not all students get the same opportunities. The grants help, but they aren’t a full substitute for stable, baseline funding. 
From me, arts are essential, not extras. They support creativity, engagement, belonging, technical skills, and storytelling. If elected, I will fight to protect and grow funding for arts across all schools, ensure equitable access regardless of neighborhood or income, and make sure arts programming is part of our budget discussions.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","Supporting arts education isn’t a side issue for me. It’s central to my vision for Bellevue schools, shaped by how deeply the arts impacted and changed my own life. Arts education aligns directly with the District’s strategic plan: We Belong, We Learn, We Lead. The arts foster belonging by giving students space to express identity, culture, skill, and creativity. They support learning by engaging students in hands-on and creative thinking. And they build leadership through performance, collaboration, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.
I also see the arts as a driver of equity, innovation, and joy in the classroom. They help close learning gaps, spark new ways of thinking, and make school a place where all students can thrive. I would prioritize arts in the budget, ensure equitable access across schools, and protect their role as a core element of a strong, inclusive public education system."

Both Garfield High School and Washington Middle School—its key jazz feeder—are in my director district. 

I’d like to highlight just one example of how precarious arts programming is in Seattle Public Schools: when Washington faced the loss of its jazz teacher due to budget cuts a couple of years ago, it threatened not just one program but the entire music pathway that sustains Garfield’s excellence. Students and families rallied to protect it, underscoring both the passion in our community and the fragility of arts funding during financial strain. I heard firsthand from many current and former students and families when cuts threatened these programs how transformative these programs truly are.

I believe we must rebuild a continuum of music education, beginning with equitable access to instrumental instruction in elementary school. As a school board director, I would champion stable funding for music education and community partnerships that ensure every student has the opportunity to learn an instrument and find their voice through the arts.

That sense of connection carried me through school and continues to influence how I lead and work today.

As a finance professional and former school board director, I know budgets are statements of values. When we cut arts programs, we send the message that creativity and connection are optional—they’re not. Arts education builds the well-being, confidence, and collaboration skills that every student needs to thrive.

My campaign is about restoring stability, trust, and joy in Seattle Public Schools. That means protecting arts and music programs, ensuring every student has access starting in elementary school, and partnering with community organizations to expand opportunities. I want every student to have the same sense of belonging and possibility that I found through the arts."

I would also like to see stronger arts-to-career pathways through partnerships with local organizations and CTE exploration.

Bethel has a vibrant foundation of arts programs supported by passionate teachers and community partnerships. However, our large geographic area, growth patterns, and budget limitations can create inequities in access. Celebrating the diverse cultures of our students, families, employees, and community brings compassion, understanding, and new perspectives that enrich the learning environment. The arts provide a bridge between cultures, helping us see the world through one another’s experiences.

I would like voters to know that I view the arts as a unifying force that connects culture, community, and creativity. With thoughtful planning, partnerships, and equitable resource allocation, we can ensure that every Bethel student experiences the transformative power of the arts.","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","Yes — the arts are a powerful way to bring communities together, to foster understanding, and to cultivate compassion. They open our lens to the world, helping students and families see themselves and others through new perspectives. Arts education is not separate from academics; it can be woven into every subject to deepen learning, creativity, and critical thinking.

In my campaign and continued service, I view the arts as an essential connector — linking culture, academics, and emotional well-being. When students create, perform, and express themselves, they gain confidence and find belonging. Supporting arts education means supporting the whole child and strengthening our community as a whole."

I chose to learn the flute and was the first fourth grader to play well enough to join the school band.  That set me on a path that defined the rest of my K-12 school years.  My involvement in music was the focus and highlight of my school day and kept me motivated to succeed.  Although I chose not to pursue music as a career, I continued to be involved in music throughout college, where I continued to take private lessons, played in ensembles and gave a joint senior recital with a friend who was a percussionist (and went on to be a scientist).  As an adult, I joined the Board of Directors of Kinhaven Music School, a summer music program I attended when I was in high school, and served as President of the Board for several years.  I also served on the Board of Directors of Musicians' Accord, a performance ensemble created and run by a college friend, who is a composer (and had the West Coast premiere of her latest opera last year at Seattle Opera).  As a parent, I made sure to expose all three of my children to the arts and encouraged them to follow their artistic passions.  My oldest son is a talented visual artist, who had paintings featured in Seattle Public Schools' Naramore exhibit at Seattle Art Museum (and one of his paintings was used the following year on the promotional materials for the Naramore exhibit).  My other son plays the harp, which led to him taking IB Music in SPS and giving a senior recital in which he played music from all continents of the world written for the harp.  My daughter plays the flute (like her mom) and was active in music throughout her K-12 years, including performing one movement of a flute concerto with the Garfield High School orchestra when she was a senior.  All three of my kids continue to be active in their artistic pursuits.   ","If elected, which of these strategies would you consider implementing?

I'm thinking of programs like jazz at several of our high schools, theater programs, orchestra. visual arts, etc.  As a parent of students who participated in these programs, I was shocked to learn that other than teacher salaries, the ""District"" provides little to no financial support.  My son's art teacher would ask families on curriculum night to contribute $25 if they were able so she could buy art supplies for her classes -- she shared that she had no budget from the school/district for supplies.  It was the same story in music -- to buy or rent music, buy supplies like music stands and buy and maintain instruments for students who couldn't afford their own required parent-led fundraising every year.  How can the arts be part of basic education but there is no funding for the critical supplies without which the arts cannot be taught?

I learned so much about myself, what I was capable of when I applied myself and practiced, and so much more about the bigger world. 

I found comfort in an otherwise chaotic life in music, learning to play four instruments (violin, clarinet, piano, and guitar) in 13 years. My love of music provided opportunities to travel with SPS—to music festivals in Gresham, OR, Anaheim, CA (where I went to Disneyland for the first time), and a 12-day tour in Japan.

Arts classes in school provided safe spaces, away from the bullying and competition to achieve, where I could relax, be myself, and find moments of joy. Looking back now, as I’m working to overcome the trauma of my childhood and give back to my community, I can see how critical it is for every child—especially those furthest from opportunity—to have access to a rich, robust, comprehensive arts education.

As an alumna of SPS, I benefitted greatly from the robust opportunities in music and arts that were available. I’m from a low-income family, and my arts education in SPS provided me with  experiences I would not have had access to otherwise, experiences that helped shape who I am and my worldview—experiences that represent bright spots in an otherwise chaotic and traumatic childhood. 

I want voters to know that I will prioritize restoration and expansion of arts programming, increased access for underserved communities, and seek community input to inform new initiatives. Arts programming is a key component of progressive education, one that is missing for too many SPS students. Addressing gaps in arts programming will be a central part of my efforts to increase student well-being, emotional wellness, and student-centered operations, which hinges upon better budgeting and financial management.

There was a local ceramic shop that my mom would take me and my sister to where we painted ceramics, and she taught me how to sew from an early age.  As I entered middle school and high school, I had the opportunity to take multiple art classes. These classes offered variety to my education and helped to embrace my creative side. Art helped to foster my problem solving knowledge, work through loss, and to learn how to troubleshoot difficult situations. Although I chose to pursue a career in the medical field, the ""out side of the box"" thinking that art helped me develop has been an invaluable asset to my professional success. Finally, as a mom of two kids, art has become an outlet from the stressors of balancing my professional duties while being an engaged parent. Art has given me the opportunity to give back to my local community and to my children's schools. As PTO president the last two years I have been able to use art to help cut down costs for PTO events by handcrafting decorations, carnival games, spirit wear, etc. Now as a school board candidate I have been able to give back to the local community by donating art pieces to fundraising events that will help raise money for local non-profits.

How arts are applied to everyday life is often variable and exciting. In today's society, the use of art is seen on social media, as a ""side hustle"" where people are selling their wares online, as well as various art platforms popularized on social media platforms.  The arts are crucial to applying STEM in youthful minds because we need to use both sides of our brains! There are several studies showing how music helps with memory, where doodling helps with understanding concepts and how color can elicit emotions.  The arts shouldn't be electives but part of everyday curriculum. So why can't we have STEMA?  The challenges are within the budgets and the unknown funding factors from the State & Federal levels.  ","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  ","I find it interesting that many public figures, movie stars, musicians, artists, may not have finished their high school education let alone college experiences, yet some are successful. These artists were able to find their niche in society and many have had second careers in other areas of business.  The creativity of our society adds value, adds fun & adds happiness. Just like applying math, science, language arts and physical activity, music, media arts and visual arts are so well imbedded in our culture that we need to continue these areas as equally as we center curriculum around STEM to have a well rounded, educated community.

Visual arts, music, performing arts, and maker crafts abound in our area. Though not all of our local artists are able to provide arts education, many creatives give their time, energy and talent abundantly in the community, including partnerships with schools. Alongside individual volunteers are a myriad of nonprofits who offer opportunities for children and youth to imagine and create.

With these strength come some challenges as well. As schools continue to feel the squeeze of time and finances state wide, there is little room an even smaller budget to feed arts programs during the school day, and organizations unaffiliated with school districts are often tuition based or have a limited number of spots in their programs. As a professional teaching artist myself (in a local nonprofit children's theatre), I also recognize that some professional artists do not have a background in education, or are unable to make a living wage as an educator outside the public school system itself.

After High School I continued to seek opportunities to engage in the arts, particularly in Theatre. I took acting/voice classes in college and performed in a college production of the Royal Hunt of The Sun at St. Philip's College. I then went on to university at Norfolk State where I took musical history classes which explored a wide diaspora of musical influences on culture, including the impact and evolution of music in African American culture.  I think arts and music have served as a gateway to understanding my culture and history and the culture and history of my neighbors, and how our cultures weave together into the vibrant tapestry that is America. 

Being raised in San Antonio, TX I was emersed in local Chicano/a arts movements from a young age, and have always celebrated the music and culture introduced to me by my mother a proud Chicana (Mexican American) who taught the beauty of music and art from a young age.

While I appreciate the volunteers in the art docent programs in our state, we are putting lipstick on the pig that is underfunding the arts in our schools. Docents typically volunteer to lead occasional lessons or activities, often relying on pre-designed materials and limited time with students. In contrast, a dedicated art program led by a certified art educator trained in art provides consistent, developmentally appropriate instruction that builds artistic skills, fosters creative thinking, and integrates art history, technique, and critique into the curriculum. Art programs also allow for deeper exploration, student expression, and equitable access to materials and instruction. While docents can enrich the learning experience, they cannot replace the depth, continuity, and educational rigor of a formal art program. I do appreciate the music teachers in our elementary schools who do a great job of teaching our kids and even put on small musical productions, but I think we can do more. ","Is there anything else you'd like to share about your vision for supporting arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?

This approach nurtures students’ self-expression, cultural awareness, and emotional well-being, while also reinforcing skills in collaboration, problem-solving, and communication. I will advocate for increased programing in the arts and increased investments in enriching our students life through the arts. "
