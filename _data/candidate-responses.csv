I still remember being one of the Barbara Shop Quartet guys. I also sang 'Thank Heaven for Little Girls' in front of 1,000 people (all for charity). Being about 9 years old at the time I was not thrilled with that song as I was supposed to do 'I have often walked down this street before' which I liked a whole lot better but when the director changes her mind, the show must go on. Me and my older sisters started doing it when I was about 7, then I continued after they got too old until about 13. I loved it, the rehearsals were long but putting the shows on (we usually did several) were a blast. When you sing a solo in front of 1,000 people you feel you can almost do anything and it gives you confidence for the rest of your life as a public speaker which, being a school board member, will help.

I also played the trumpet in school but acting was definitely a  character builder.

I loved my years of instrumental and vocal music. Music centered me and fostered an ability to face the rest of the day. As a young neurodivergent student (decades before those traits were well understood) I didn't know how fundamental music education was to succeeding at school. Research has since informed us why. Kids who study music and arts do better at core academics. 

Trauma-informed and culturally responsive practices can only improve that offering by fostering interest in more students for their education. Learning is exponentiated even more when a student perceives physical, social, and emotional safety throughout their day.

I currently work in schools and I have seen firsthand how our students are struggling as they return to school following Covid, or when students from marginalized communities see their very existence politicized in ways that they internalize.

At the same time, I have continued to sing with church choirs, as well as the New York City Opera Chorus at Wolftrap in the late 1970's and the Pacific Northwest Opera Chorus for the last several years.

I do think the one area we have the most opportunity for growth is in collaborating with the arts and music teachers to make sure there is vertical alignment about what our districtwide continuum should look like. Since our art/music/PE expansion is still relatively new, that hasn't quite happened.","When we started our family liaison program during COVID, we asked those staff members to help us establish an Olympia specific vision for what culturally responsive family engagement should look like (with an emphasis on a dual capacity model). I hope we can use a similar process to help us formalize that approach to arts education. From my own observations during school visits, I would say some of the places that are doing that work in really exciting ways are our elementary music and art classrooms.

To which I would reply ""Is that what you say to your chemistry teacher? I'd like to take chemistry, but I don't know anything about it."" ""No, that is absurd. You expect that the chemistry teacher will teach you that art just I will teach you theatre."" Students need be exposed to art from a young age just as they are science, math, and reading. The difference is that a child may go their whole life at home and in school never hearing a concert, seeing a play, browsing in a museum, or attending  to the ballet. It is critical that the schools help students open this door to themselves as artists.
The Arts are a Core Subject by federal and state law. Let's start treating them that way. ","It is vital that students be part of social justice to feel themselves within the art. It is the most important thing we can do in education is allow students a voice to speak to their feelings, worries, experiences, and to give flight to how they see the future. This is possible every single day. For 20 years I taught theatre where each year students wrote, directed, acted, danced and sung new works that they created in and outside the classroom. They spoke of their trauma, their lives, their needs, their cultural experience by putting it on stage for all to see. This was the best work I did as teacher whether it is the young girl who taught seven others to do traditional Thai dancing none of whom were Thai as she was, the 9th grader who wrote a play about a boy coming of age and attempting to hide his homosexual feelings, or the group of ten students who put rap music to skater moves on stage while a narrator pronounced a slam poem. These students put everything in their being into their art and it was critical to listen to them. Let's allow each student a clear and unrestrained voice through the arts. "

Recruiting and retaining talented teachers is a priority in all areas, but definitely in this area.  Finally I will encourage my board and superintendent to make sure these priorities are reflected in the strategic planning we are undertaking.  The community and the students are very clear that this is a necessary tradition in our district.","Like I said, art, creativity, etc has never been my path, but I have seen what it means for kids and adults.  The Arts is at minimum enriching and part of a well-rounded education.  But very often it is oneís identity, their voice, their salvation and survival.  Kids in my district are struggling like all districts.  In a rural town the healthy outlets and experiences are not ìjust down the street.î  So itís critical that  any student who walks through our doors is encouraged and supported in finding their creative voice in whatever medium that is meaningful to them."

It afforded me the ability to think outside of the box and appreciate differing interpretations.","Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district; Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan; Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers; Support trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts teachers; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability; Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations","As a lover and supporter of the arts, I wholeheartedly support SB 5878 and as School Board Director, I will ensure that arts instruction is provided in the districtís curriculum. I would look over the bill and compare it to the current curriculum and ask questions where I find discrepancies and request that we fix the gaps.","Our world is facing unprecedented challenges albeit division of politics, war and social justice, which are compounded by Social Media. Having access to express oneself is vital for oneís mental health and expression. Our district is equally riddled with gang violence, but having creative outlets will help not only with mental health but give students a purpose and will decrease violence, absenteeism and will increase retention."
