I went to a high school in a rural town in southern Idaho.  We didn?t have much, but I participated in Yearbook (as a class) and in Theater (as an after school activity).   I participated in both theater and Yearbook for all of high school.

Yearbook was a way for me to practice photography, layout (the Non Digital way), planning, organization, and project management.  I think a lot of my organizational skills came from deadlines from yearbook class. I had an amazing advisor that let me use my strengths.

Theater taught me to look into myself to find my own strength. I learned how to project my voice, public speaking, and how to be a leader.  When I went to college, I thought I was going to be a theater major until I found my passion in education.

Both activities helped guide me to where I am today.  I couldn?t be the teacher I am today without the skills in my arts education.

Our students are individuals and will always have individual needs and interests in the arts (as other fields), so it is critical that they all can engage in their own schools, or access a program easily, according to that interest. 'Art' is a dynamic field so there will always be new forms and it is incumbent on us to make sure our programs and materials are current and up to date. It is our goal (mine) to ensure that every student has equitable access to all the art forms from an early age. Some schools have more community support than others can afford in areas such as science and the arts. We need to make sure that the generosity of individual communities does not establish inequities in opportunity across the district and so put the funds where they are needed, support grant and partnership opportunities to bring it in and always celebrate it in all its forms to encourage our students to participate--and make sure we are staffed accordingly.

121,Puget Sound Educational Service District,Northshore,School District,Five,Amy Cast,"Dance, Music, Media ","Dance, photography and musical performance was foundational to my personal expression and sense of community while I was growing up. I was a somewhat shy child, and I felt like I could truly bloom in the arts.  I had incredibly supportive teachers, and my choir teacher even allowed me to lead the performance of a song I wrote.  I know personally that it is through the arts that a student's voice and passion can truly be seen.","I have been passionate about expanding access to the arts in all Northshore schools. One example is how I pursued and succeeded in finding resources to add another period to our high school schedules.  We had too many students who couldn't fit the arts into their schedule given growing graduation requirements.  After adding a 7th period to the schedule, participation in the arts grew by over 30%.  Similarly, I have pursued removing barriers to access in the younger grades.  Northshore has a long history of vibrant music programs in our elementary schools.  However, the optional band and strings programs were conducted before the school day.  After a few years of study, the optional band and strings was moved to every school during the day.  The results:  we doubled the amount of 5th graders participating in the program.

121,Puget Sound Educational Service District,Northshore,School District,Five,Amy Felt,"Visual Arts, Music, Theater",I performed in my High School theater productions.  Performing gave me confidence and improved my ability to speak in public. ,"In our district, there is an art docent program largely utilized in our elementary classrooms and run by the local school PTA.  There are resources available to docents from the district.  I would work to make more resources available to this program.  I would encourage art docents from schools that have a robust program to volunteer some of their time at schools that have less resources and parent involvement.  Students love engaging in the art lessons, so expanding this program to school communities where it is not offered regularly would be a goal.

An improvement recently made in our district was offering elementary band during regular school hours which allows for more students to access this program.  It had previously been offered before school.

In secondary schools, band, orchestra, choir theater, visual and media arts are offered.  Continued financial support of these programs is vital.  Our district could improve with offerings for dance as I am not aware of many offerings in that area.
As a parent to students in the elementary, middle and high school, I understand the value the arts programs bring to children's education.  I will support and encourage the existing programs in our district to continue along with encouraging expanding into new programs and options.

I joined the debate team at my university, helping to write, rehearse, and perform with a team of students -- some still friends 30+ years later. I have a better appreciation for art. I'm fortunate to have been able to travel and see in person some of the art I studied in my humanities classes, and can still remember why certain pieces of art define their era. I now count photography as an important hobby and outlet for creativity. I've enjoyed sharing the theater with my sons, from children's theater through Broadway productions. They each chose to get involved in music, and I've seen them grow and perform in elementary school on through high school bands, jazz bands, and college and community symphonies. The arts have been central to some amazing family experiences.","I want to make sure that we bring instrumental music, orchestra, and choir programs back to each of our elementary schools to minimize access to transportation as a barrier to access.  We need to support the art docent programs that have used volunteers to assist teachers and helped to provide supplemental visual arts programming at our elementary schools. Not all schools are able to rely on volunteers, nor should we build programs that assume they can.  At our junior high schools we need to identify and address sources of turnover in our music programs. Turnover is keeping schools from developing programs and providing consistency to our students. Our high schools have been better about providing access, but could benefit from having students who had earlier exposure to the arts to help develop and build interest. Dance programs are largely nonexistent outside of whatever is offered in connection to a theater production.","Research current arts program and assess needs at district buildings; Develop or update a district level arts plan; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities; Work for a budget to financially support arts instruction at all schools; Support professional development for classroom teachers; Create a local arts education task force; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking, support, and accountability; Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies"

121,Puget Sound Educational Service District,Seattle,Public School,Four,Laura Marie Rivera,"Music, Media , Visual Arts, Dance, Theater","It is safe to say that the ARTS have had a huge impact on my Education, Career, Family, and Community. My first career was as a Broadway Performer. I danced all over the country- from Seattle to Maine, and even throughout Europe. Formative opportunities that I never would have had if it hadn't been for my arts education. Since then, I have grown into Arts Education and nonprofit management. My work at Crystal Bridged Museum included a groundbreaking study that directly correlates Art Education and measurable gains in Critical Thinking and Empathy.
While I know that not everyone will pursue a career in the arts, I believe that all students need to have quality arts education and exposure to all of the amazing cultural opportunities that are available in our city. And I am committed to creating equitable access for the students in Seattle Public Schools.","Throughout my campaign, I have repeatedly advocated for the best possible education for all of our Seattle students. Of course, we know that there are a lot of students that have been receiving less for years. This absolutely has to stop and we need to immediately open up access to all of our best programming to students throughout the district.
In the above section, I marked Needs Improvement for all levels. The truth is that it is far more nuanced than that. Seattle has some amazing arts and cultural programs that would definitely qualify as Robust. The first time I saw Ballard High School's annual musical, I was blown away. Keep in mind, this is what I used to do for a living and I recognized that I was looking at future Broadway stars up on that stage. Sincerely, the best high school musical I have ever seen. And right before the pandemic, a Tony winning composer friend of mine was in town to do a workshop and performance with the musicians at Roosevelt High School. I was in awe of the program and opportunity these students were a part of.
And on the other end of the scale, we have schools with NO music programs and NO art. These programs are literally Not Available at some of our schools because of the way we correlate funding and enrollment numbers. The arts are absolutely an integral part of a student's education. Whether we have 100 students or 1,000- we need to provide access to quality arts education, the same as any other discipline.
We need to make sure that our schools are fully funded. Full stop.
This is an issue that goes beyond the School Board and I am fully prepared to advocate at the city, state, and national levels. There is no reason that city as rich as ours should not be funding the future. And that is exactly how I see it. We have over 50,000 students and that means 50,000 futures in our hands. This our chance to give our kids their best prospects for a brighter future. After all, they are our future rockstars, captains of industry, coworkers, caregivers, and neighbors. They deserve the best!","Research current arts program and assess needs at district buildings; Develop or update a district level arts plan; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities; Work for a budget to financially support arts instruction at all schools; Support professional development for classroom teachers; Create a local arts education task force; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking, support, and accountability; Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; We need to put the ""A"" in STEAM.

Not only do the arts make Seattle the amazing city that it is, the industry as a whole provides thousands of jobs and improves all of our lives.

My mother was an extremely talented actress and playwright and she directed both children's theater as well as adult theater for 30+ years I recognize the critical importance of the Arts (in all forms) in the social emotional, physical, and academic development of children and youth.  I provided a broad arts-based foundation for my own 2 daughters filled with live theater, music, visual arts and dance.  Both played Suzuki violin for over 10 years each and participated in youth theater and dance.  We regularly attended the NW Sinfionetta and live theater in Tacoma and Seattle.","In recognition of the importance of the arts in social emotional and academic excellence and to provide equitable access to the arts and other educational opportunities, Tacoma Public Schools has created specialty schools that focus on the arts in robust ways, including 2 fully immersed Montessori schools (Geiger Elementary = pre-K - 5th and Bryant Elementary & Middle = pre-K - 8th), a feeder system of IB credentialed schools (elementary introduction, middle & high), one elementary arts magnet school (Grant Center for the Expressive Arts), and 3 highly regarded specialty high schools:  Tacoma School of the Arts (SOTA), Science & Math Institute (SAMI), and Industrial Design, Engineering & Art (iDEA).  I will continue to fight to broaden the scope and availability of these types of opportunities at every school in the district to ensure that every student has the chance to benefit from music, visual arts, dance, media arts, and theater.  I understand that staffing for the Arts is often chaotic and uneven.  The root of this problem is the woefully inadequate state apportionment funding allocated to ""specialists"" providing Arts instruction.  I will continue to push for a more holistic approach to this formula to increase funding for staff in severely underfunded areas such as the Arts and mental health counseling, especially in areas of the district with students farthest from economic and educational opportunities.","Research current arts program and assess needs at district buildings; Develop or update a district level arts plan; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities; Work for a budget to financially support arts instruction at all schools; Support professional development for classroom teachers; Create a local arts education task force; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking, support, and accountability; Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Partner with City of Tacoma and Metro Parks Tacoma to expand opportunities for art enrichment for students before/after school, during breaks, and throughout the summer."

I entered and won several art contests as a young student, attended various art classes for years at an art institute as a middle schooler on a scholarship, played the trumpet for 8 years in grades 4-12, and even entered college on a design arts scholarship. After high school, I continued to pursue the arts in various forms throughout college (photography, graphic design, drawing, etc.), and have sought out visits to exhibits and performances in all areas. During my brief stint as a Montessori teacher, I taught math, science, and art to 1st and 2nd graders, and even drew weekly cartoons for the students on the white board every Friday. I currently create charcoal sketches and portraits in my free time, and try to find other ways to immerse myself in art in my daily life.

I have chosen to run on a platform of not just STEM, but STEAM education. Art has a place in science, and vice versa. ","Recognizing that our students come from a plethora of cultural and racial backgrounds is one facet to school safety. Creating equitable lesson plans in the arts that are designed with diversity in mind will go a long way in making sure all of our students feel seen and heard. Ignoring the fact that our students are all different in many ways, including economically and racially, would be doing a disservice to those students who come from historically underrepresented communities. Teaching our students to appreciate and embrace ALL differences is not divisive, as some have tried to argue; rather, it creates an environment of understanding and empathy, which is sorely needed in the world today.

Education should be a basic right for all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status or cultural background. Understanding the obstacles students face both in and out of the classroom in paramount to advocating for them and their achievement, and to enacting vital legislation meant to reduce barriers to success. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, for example, was passed to provide support and resources for students experiencing homelessness, while the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ensures that public schools cannot inquire about, and therefore potentially discriminate against, a student?s immigration status. While a lot has been done thus far to try to create an equal and equitable playing field for all students, there is still a lot of work to be done in providing underrepresented students a quality arts education, free from obstacles and burdens. This includes providing support, culturally-sensitive curricula, and effective anti-bullying techniques.

I would love to see more programs offered both in the schools and outside of school hours. Offering programs online would help those students without access to transportation, and offering free or reduced-cost transportation, along with free or reduced-cost art programs, can go far in reaching the most number of students possible.","Research current arts program and assess needs at district buildings; Develop or update a district level arts plan; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities; Work for a budget to financially support arts instruction at all schools; Support professional development for classroom teachers; Create a local arts education task force; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking, support, and accountability; Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Working closely with local established art communities, like the Academy of Children's Theater, the Richland Players, the Allied Arts Center, etc. to offer free or reduced-cost programs and opportunities to all area students."
