  response3: |-
    I had limited exposure to the arts growing up but discovered them as a young adult — and that discovery was transformative. Engaging with the arts sharpened my critical thinking, helped me see problems from new angles, and deeply influenced how I approach strategy development in advancing health, education, and social policies.

    The arts taught me to ask better questions, embrace complexity, and connect with people in more authentic ways. That’s why I believe arts education is a critical equity issue — it builds the kinds of thinkers and leaders we need.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    One of the biggest challenges our district faces is the continued underfunding of education at all levels. Despite this, our educators and students show incredible creativity and resilience in keeping arts programming alive.

    I believe arts education is essential, not optional. It’s a powerful tool for building critical thinking, creativity, and connection — skills that benefit every student, regardless of their path. I want voters to know that when we invest in the arts, we invest in a more equitable, well-rounded education that supports both academic and personal growth.

    If we’re serious about educational equity and preparing students for a complex world, we need to treat the arts as core to our mission — and fund them accordingly.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: "When I talk about ensuring that every student thrives, I mean giving
    them access to a well-rounded education that includes the arts. Creative learning
    builds critical thinking, problem-solving, and emotional expression. These are
    all essential skills for success in college, career, and life.\n\nIn building
    healthy and connected communities, the arts play a powerful role. They bring people
    together across cultures, generations, and neighborhoods. Arts programs help schools
    feel welcoming and inclusive, and they give students and families a voice in how
    their stories are told.\n\nSupporting valued educators means recognizing that
    arts educators are essential, too. We must ensure they are well-supported, well-compensated,
    and included in decision-making — just like their colleagues in other subject
    areas.\n\nAnd when it comes to purposeful and accountable leadership, I believe
    arts funding reflects our values. If we say we care about equity, student engagement,
    and whole-child learning, our budgets need to show it. That means protecting and
    investing in arts programs. \n\nArts education is part of how we build stronger
    schools and a stronger future. "

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: The arts were such an important part of my public school experience.
    I played saxophone in the school band from 5th through 10th grade, which taught
    me how to read music, work as a team, and feel confident performing. I still remember
    how much I loved ceramics in elementary school, helping with our high school production
    of Once on This Island, and being an anchor on the middle school news program.
    Those experiences made school more engaging and meaningful—and they’ve helped
    shape me into a more creative, well-rounded person as an adult. I believe every
    student deserves the same chance to grow through the arts.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    One challenge in our district is that elementary schools don’t have dedicated art specialists. Art is either teacher-led or supported through PTA-run Art Docent programs. I’ve been an Art Docent at Fruitland Elementary for four years now and have seen how meaningful these experiences are. I’d love to find more ways to support and grow these programs.

    As we face budget shortfalls, it’s important to protect music and art programs at all levels as well as CTE programs that help students explore creative careers after high school. The arts should be part of every student’s experience in Puyallup schools, whether it’s a passion or a profession.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    For me, arts education is a big part of what makes school special. It helps kids get creative, build confidence, and learn skills they’ll use in all parts of life. My campaign is focused on supporting a well-rounded education here in Puyallup that helps every student succeed, not just in academics, but in everything that makes them who they are.

    I want to make sure the arts get the attention and funding they deserve alongside other important programs. When we invest in the arts, we’re investing in our kids and the future of our community. That’s what I’ll fight for on the school board—making sure every student in Puyallup has access to great arts opportunities.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: 'The arts shaped both my education and my career. As a theater student
    in high school, I found my voice, learned to collaborate, and built the confidence
    to take risks. Those experiences didn’t just make me a stronger performer, they
    made me a stronger learner and leader. After high school, the arts continued to
    open doors, giving me opportunities to teach, to connect with students who don’t
    always see themselves reflected in traditional academics, and to create spaces
    where every young person can belong. The lessons I learned through the arts: creativity,
    resilience, teamwork, and empathy, are the same lessons I carry into my classroom
    and into my leadership today.'

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    Kent has incredible student talent and a deep well of creativity, but access to arts programming is uneven across the district. Some schools have thriving theater, music, and visual arts programs, while others struggle with limited resources, scheduling conflicts, or staffing shortages. What’s unique here is that despite these challenges, our students still produce inspiring performances and artwork that show how essential the arts are to learning and belonging.

    I want voters to know that I see the arts as core to education, not an “extra.” The arts build confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork, the very skills we want every graduate to have. As a teacher, I’ve seen how theater engages students who might otherwise feel disconnected from school, and I believe every child in Kent should have that same opportunity. Strengthening and expanding equitable access to arts education will always be part of how I think about student success.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education is woven into my vision for public schools because it’s about more than creativity. It’s about belonging, voice, and opportunity. As a theater and math teacher, I’ve seen students light up when they discover a stage, a paintbrush, or an instrument. The arts can transform school into a place where students feel connected, seen, and proud of what they create.

    For me, supporting arts education means ensuring it is accessible in every school, not just a select few. It means prioritizing funding, staffing, and scheduling that allow students to fully participate in music, theater, and visual arts alongside their core classes.

    My campaign is about making sure every student has the best education experience possible, and the arts are a powerful part of that. They prepare students for life after graduation just as much as reading, math, and science and they make schools joyful places to be.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: |-
    My experiences with the arts have been foundational to both my education and my personal development. Growing up, I was deeply involved in theater and music, which taught me discipline, creativity, and the value of self-expression. These experiences helped me develop confidence, resilience, public speaking and a collaborative spirit, skills that have served me well in every stage of life.

    After high school, the arts continued to shape my worldview. Whether volunteering as an Art Docent or organizing community events like school variety shows, I’ve seen firsthand how the arts bring people together and foster a sense of belonging. These experiences have reinforced my belief that arts education is not a luxury, it’s essential. It nurtures critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and innovation, all of which are vital for student success in today’s world.

    As a candidate for school district director, I’m committed to ensuring that arts programs are protected and expanded. Every student deserves the opportunity to explore their creativity and discover their voice through the arts.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    The Issaquah School District has a proud tradition of supporting arts education, with programs that span visual arts, music, theater, and dance. One of our greatest strengths is the Evergreen Philharmonic Orchestra—a full symphonic ensemble of 80 honor students selected by audition from Issaquah High, Liberty, and Skyline. These students rehearse weekly and perform an ambitious schedule of concerts. This level of excellence reflects the district’s commitment to nurturing talent and providing meaningful opportunities for artistic growth.

    However, challenges persist. A major issue is access to adequate performance and rehearsal spaces. Local groups like the Issaquah Philharmonic Orchestra face “creative constraints” due to limited space and equipment storage, which can impact the quality and inclusivity of performances 2. These limitations not only affect student and community engagement but also restrict the full expression of artistic potential.

    As a candidate for school district director, I believe arts education should be accessible, well-resourced, and integrated into the broader educational experience. I support expanding partnerships with community arts organizations, investing in infrastructure, and ensuring that every student—regardless of background—has the opportunity to explore and thrive in the arts. The arts are not extracurricular; they are essential to developing well-rounded, innovative, and empathetic learners.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education is not just a passion of mine, it’s a pillar of my vision for a thriving, inclusive school district. I’ve seen firsthand how the arts empower students to think creatively, build confidence, and connect with their communities. I’ve witnessed the transformative power of creative expression.

    As a candidate for school district director, I believe that arts education must be treated as essential, not optional. It should be accessible to every student, regardless of background or ability. That means advocating for equitable funding for arts programs across all schools, adequate facilities for rehearsals, performances, and exhibitions and community partnerships that enrich arts opportunities and bring local talent into our schools.
    Curriculum integration that connects arts to core subjects, enhancing learning across the board.

    Arts education fits into my broader campaign goals of student well-being, academic excellence, and community engagement. When students are given the tools to express themselves, they thrive—not just academically, but emotionally and socially. I want voters to know that I will champion policies that protect and expand arts programming, because I believe every child deserves the chance to discover their voice and their potential through the arts.

  response3: My experiences with the arts were an essential part of my education and
    continue to influence my life today. From 5th through 12th grade I played violin
    in my school orchestra, and in high school I also performed with our steel drum
    band. While I did not pursue music formally after graduation, the discipline,
    collaboration, and creativity I developed through those programs have stayed with
    me. These experiences gave me a deep appreciation for the arts and music, broadened
    my perspective on the world, and strengthened skills like focus, teamwork, and
    resilience that I continue to draw on in my professional and personal life.

    Showcase and student success in PTA Reflections. Having grown up in these programs
    myself and now watching my own children participate, I know how deeply they shape
    our students and community. Our biggest challenge is ensuring sustainable funding
    and equitable access so that every student can participate fully, regardless of

  response5: Kent School District’s arts programs showcase incredible student talent

    Not all schools have the same resources, and arts are often at risk during budget
    cuts. I believe arts education is essential to student growth, creativity, and

    in traditional academic settings. As a board member and leadership consultant,

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: My experience with the arts had a lasting impact on my college education
    and life beyond high school in both practical and professional ways. It gave me
    the confidence to speak in front of large groups and communicate ideas with clarity
    and conviction. In college, I double-majored in political science and drama, gaining
    a well-rounded education that combined analytical thinking with creative expression.
    After college, I pursued advanced theatre training in New York and built a career
    as a working actor, performing in regional theatres, national tours, and on cruise
    ships. The arts offered a creative outlet, kept me physically active, and provided
    steady work. It also deepened my appreciation for unions and collective bargaining.
    As I transitioned into a career in accounting and finance, the skills I developed
    through the arts, especially storytelling, helped me translate complex financial
    data into clear, actionable insights that empowered leadership to make informed
    decisions.

    video production, graphic design, technical theater and more in our CTE options.
    There is also support through grants from PTAs and community partners that enable
    teachers to bring performances, field trips, and innovative arts projects into
    classrooms. \nBut there are challenges. Budget constraints, rising costs, and
    underfunded state support are putting pressure on arts enrichment. The district
    must cut spending in many areas and if the situation worsens, arts programs may
    face cuts or reduced resources. Also, there can be inequality in access since
    some schools may have more resources (e.g. more PTA funding) than others or charge
    access fees, which means not all students get the same opportunities. The grants
    help, but they aren’t a full substitute for stable, baseline funding. \nFrom me,
    arts are essential, not extras. They support creativity, engagement, belonging,
    technical skills, and storytelling. If elected, I will fight to protect and grow
    funding for arts across all schools, ensure equitable access regardless of neighborhood
    or income, and make sure arts programming is part of our budget discussions."
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Supporting arts education isn’t a side issue for me. It’s central to my vision for Bellevue schools, shaped by how deeply the arts impacted and changed my own life. Arts education aligns directly with the District’s strategic plan: We Belong, We Learn, We Lead. The arts foster belonging by giving students space to express identity, culture, skill, and creativity. They support learning by engaging students in hands-on and creative thinking. And they build leadership through performance, collaboration, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.
    I also see the arts as a driver of equity, innovation, and joy in the classroom. They help close learning gaps, spark new ways of thinking, and make school a place where all students can thrive. I would prioritize arts in the budget, ensure equitable access across schools, and protect their role as a core element of a strong, inclusive public education system.

    teamwork, and an appreciation for cultural expression. These experiences built
    confidence and taught me how to listen, collaborate, and commit to long-term practice.
    They also helped me balance academics with creativity, making me a more well-rounded
    student. After high school, I’ve carried that love for the arts into my adult
    life—as an audience member who continues to seek inspiration, joy, and community
    through music, dance, and performance.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: "Seattle’s public schools have an extraordinary musical legacy—from elementary
    classrooms where students first pick up an instrument to the national award-winning
    Garfield High School Jazz Ensemble, a source of citywide pride and cultural identity.
    Both Garfield High School and Washington Middle School—its key jazz feeder—are
    in my director district. \n\nI’d like to highlight just one example of how precarious
    arts programming is in Seattle Public Schools: when Washington faced the loss
    of its jazz teacher due to budget cuts a couple of years ago, it threatened not
    just one program but the entire music pathway that sustains Garfield’s excellence.
    Students and families rallied to protect it, underscoring both the passion in
    our community and the fragility of arts funding during financial strain. I heard
    firsthand from many current and former students and families when cuts threatened
    these programs how transformative these programs truly are.\n\nI believe we must
    rebuild a continuum of music education, beginning with equitable access to instrumental
    instruction in elementary school. As a school board director, I would champion
    stable funding for music education and community partnerships that ensure every
    student has the opportunity to learn an instrument and find their voice through
    the arts. These programs are not extras—they are essential to student belonging,
    confidence, and lifelong success."
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education isn’t just a policy priority for me—it’s personal. I played in the school orchestra from third grade through twelfth grade, and those experiences shaped who I am. Orchestra gave me a sense of belonging, discipline, and joy. It was where I found my community and my confidence. Making music together reminded me that I was part of something larger than myself. That sense of connection carried me through school and continues to influence how I lead and work today.

    As a finance professional and former school board director, I know budgets are statements of values. When we cut arts programs, we send the message that creativity and connection are optional—they’re not. Arts education builds the well-being, confidence, and collaboration skills that every student needs to thrive.

    My campaign is about restoring stability, trust, and joy in Seattle Public Schools. That means protecting arts and music programs, ensuring every student has access starting in elementary school, and partnering with community organizations to expand opportunities. I want every student to have the same sense of belonging and possibility that I found through the arts.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: |-
    The arts have been at the heart of my identity and education from an early age. Growing up on Guam as a Pacific Islander of Chamorro descent, my life was immersed in cultural folk arts, dance, music, and visual storytelling. The island’s traditions—our fiestas, Catholic faith, and Pacific Islander way of life—are all interwoven through art and expression. These experiences taught me creativity, discipline, collaboration, and pride in community—skills that shaped my academic success and continue to guide my leadership today.
    Even after moving to Washington decades ago, those cultural roots remain strong. My family continues to celebrate and share our Chamorro and Filipino heritage through music, dance, and gatherings that welcome all cultures. Arts education nurtures empathy, critical thinking, and connection—qualities that help students thrive both personally and academically. Growing up surrounded by the arts showed me that creativity is not extracurricular; it is foundational to learning, identity, and the human experience.

  response5: |-
    My vision is for every student in Bethel to have meaningful, equitable access to arts education—regardless of where they live, their background, identity, or their learning needs. The arts are not a luxury; they are an essential part of a well-rounded education that builds creativity, confidence, and critical thinking. I believe arts education should be integrated across subjects and accessible to all students, including those receiving special education or language supports.

    I would prioritize assessing current access to arts programming across the district, ensuring funding is equitable, and expanding opportunities for students in both visual and performing arts. I support collaboration between classroom teachers, teaching artists, and community partners, as well as professional development for teachers to incorporate the arts into their curriculum. I would also like to see stronger arts-to-career pathways through partnerships with local organizations and CTE exploration.

    Bethel has a vibrant foundation of arts programs supported by passionate teachers and community partnerships. However, our large geographic area, growth patterns, and budget limitations can create inequities in access. Celebrating the diverse cultures of our students, families, employees, and community brings compassion, understanding, and new perspectives that enrich the learning environment. The arts provide a bridge between cultures, helping us see the world through one another’s experiences.

    I would like voters to know that I view the arts as a unifying force that connects culture, community, and creativity. With thoughtful planning, partnerships, and equitable resource allocation, we can ensure that every Bethel student experiences the transformative power of the arts.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Yes — the arts are a powerful way to bring communities together, to foster understanding, and to cultivate compassion. They open our lens to the world, helping students and families see themselves and others through new perspectives. Arts education is not separate from academics; it can be woven into every subject to deepen learning, creativity, and critical thinking.

    In my campaign and continued service, I view the arts as an essential connector — linking culture, academics, and emotional well-being. When students create, perform, and express themselves, they gain confidence and find belonging. Supporting arts education means supporting the whole child and strengthening our community as a whole.

  response3: 'In 4th grade, at my public school in New York, we had the opportunity
    to choose to learn to play a musical instrument.  I chose to learn the flute and
    was the first fourth grader to play well enough to join the school band.  That
    set me on a path that defined the rest of my K-12 school years.  My involvement
    in music was the focus and highlight of my school day and kept me motivated to
    succeed.  Although I chose not to pursue music as a career, I continued to be
    involved in music throughout college, where I continued to take private lessons,
    played in ensembles and gave a joint senior recital with a friend who was a percussionist
    (and went on to be a scientist).  As an adult, I joined the Board of Directors
    of Kinhaven Music School, a summer music program I attended when I was in high
    school, and served as President of the Board for several years.  I also served
    on the Board of Directors of Musicians'' Accord, a performance ensemble created
    and run by a college friend, who is a composer (and had the West Coast premiere
    of her latest opera last year at Seattle Opera).  As a parent, I made sure to
    expose all three of my children to the arts and encouraged them to follow their
    artistic passions.  My oldest son is a talented visual artist, who had paintings
    featured in Seattle Public Schools'' Naramore exhibit at Seattle Art Museum (and
    one of his paintings was used the following year on the promotional materials
    for the Naramore exhibit).  My other son plays the harp, which led to him taking
    IB Music in SPS and giving a senior recital in which he played music from all
    continents of the world written for the harp.  My daughter plays the flute (like
    her mom) and was active in music throughout her K-12 years, including performing
    one movement of a flute concerto with the Garfield High School orchestra when

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts

  response5: 'Seattle has schools with long histories of phenomenal arts programming,
    including national recognition.  I''m thinking of programs like jazz at several
    of our high schools, theater programs, orchestra. visual arts, etc.  As a parent
    of students who participated in these programs, I was shocked to learn that other
    than teacher salaries, the "District" provides little to no financial support.  My
    son''s art teacher would ask families on curriculum night to contribute $25 if
    they were able so she could buy art supplies for her classes -- she shared that
    she had no budget from the school/district for supplies.  It was the same story
    in music -- to buy or rent music, buy supplies like music stands and buy and maintain
    instruments for students who couldn''t afford their own required parent-led fundraising
    every year.  How can the arts be part of basic education but there is no funding
    for the critical supplies without which the arts cannot be taught?  If elected,
    I would like to do a deeper dive into this issue to better understand it and then
    work on solutions.  '

    that all three of my children have had the opportunity to participate as well.  I
    see the benefits in my own family on a daily basis.  It''s extremely important
    to me that arts education and opportunities for participation in the arts are
    available to all children at school and that especially in a time of budget pressures,
    we find a way to maintain arts education.  We cannot restrict opportunity for
    our children.  '

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: "My experiences with the arts, both inside and outside Seattle Public
    Schools, had a profound impact on my life. I learned so much about myself, what
    I was capable of when I applied myself and practiced, and so much more about the
    bigger world. \n\nI found comfort in an otherwise chaotic life in music, learning
    to play four instruments (violin, clarinet, piano, and guitar) in 13 years. My
    love of music provided opportunities to travel with SPS—to music festivals in
    Gresham, OR, Anaheim, CA (where I went to Disneyland for the first time), and
    a 12-day tour in Japan.\n\nArts classes in school provided safe spaces, away from
    the bullying and competition to achieve, where I could relax, be myself, and find
    moments of joy. Looking back now, as I’m working to overcome the trauma of my
    childhood and give back to my community, I can see how critical it is for every

  response5: "One of the biggest challenges we face in Seattle Public Schools to arts
    programming is our budget—lack of board oversight has led to a persistent deficit
    and cuts to what was a preeminent, nationally recognized program. \n\nAs an alumna
    of SPS, I benefitted greatly from the robust opportunities in music and arts that
    were available. I’m from a low-income family, and my arts education in SPS provided
    me with  experiences I would not have had access to otherwise, experiences that
    helped shape who I am and my worldview—experiences that represent bright spots
    in an otherwise chaotic and traumatic childhood. \n\nI want voters to know that
    I will prioritize restoration and expansion of arts programming, increased access
    for underserved communities, and seek community input to inform new initiatives.
    Arts programming is a key component of progressive education, one that is missing
    for too many SPS students. Addressing gaps in arts programming will be a central
    part of my efforts to increase student well-being, emotional wellness, and student-centered

  response3: 'My mother painted ceramics and sewed crafts when I was a young child

    my mom would take me and my sister to where we painted ceramics, and she taught
    me how to sew from an early age.  As I entered middle school and high school,
    I had the opportunity to take multiple art classes. These classes offered variety
    to my education and helped to embrace my creative side. Art helped to foster my
    problem solving knowledge, work through loss, and to learn how to troubleshoot
    difficult situations. Although I chose to pursue a career in the medical field,
    the "out side of the box" thinking that art helped me develop has been an invaluable
    asset to my professional success. Finally, as a mom of two kids, art has become
    an outlet from the stressors of balancing my professional duties while being an

    carnival games, spirit wear, etc. Now as a school board candidate I have been
