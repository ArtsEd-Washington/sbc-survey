  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: As an immigrant learning English, the arts became my universal language.
    Onstage and in the classroom I could express ideas, connect with others, and find
    a place to thrive when words failed me. The arts helped me manage the stress of
    not yet knowing English, build confidence, and translate that courage into academic
    success and community involvement after high school.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    One of the unique strengths of our district’s arts programming is that it gives students, especially English language learners, a space where they can participate fully without the pressure of language barriers. The arts are a universal language that build confidence, creativity, and connection. For many students, including those from immigrant families like mine, the arts provide a way to thrive and express themselves while they are still learning English.

    A challenge I see is making sure that all students have equal access to arts opportunities, regardless of which school they attend or their family’s resources. Sometimes, the arts are treated as an “extra,” when in reality they are an essential part of student development and wellbeing.

    What I would like voters to know is that I believe in protecting and expanding arts education because it is not just about drawing or performing—it is about giving every student the tools to communicate, to de-stress, and to discover their strengths. For many, the arts are the first place they truly feel seen and capable, and that experience can change the trajectory of their education and life.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Yes. A core part of my vision is ensuring that arts education is accessible and inclusive for all students, including those with special needs. The arts provide unique benefits for students with different learning styles and abilities—whether it’s improving communication, supporting emotional regulation, or building confidence through self-expression.

    In my campaign, I see the arts not as a luxury, but as an essential tool for equity. For students with special needs, the arts can open doors to learning and participation in ways that traditional instruction cannot. By supporting strong and inclusive arts programs, we create classrooms where every child can thrive, feel valued, and discover their strengths.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: The Yakima School District has dedicated educators and many talented
    students, and our arts programs benefit from passionate teachers and community
    support. However, like many districts, we face challenges including limited budgets,
    staffing constraints, and barriers to equitable access across schools. Geographic
    distance, varying income levels, and student-specific needs, such as special education
    or language support, can limit consistent arts opportunities. My perspective is
    that arts education is essential to student engagement, creativity, and academic
    success. If elected, I will work to ensure all students have meaningful access
    to the arts, advocate for sufficient funding, support teacher development, and
    strengthen community partnerships to expand opportunities for all of our students.

  response6: Arts education is essential to a well-rounded education, supporting creativity,
    critical thinking, and student engagement. My campaign is focused on strengthening
    our schools, supporting teachers, and ensuring all students have access to high-quality
    learning experiences. Arts education is a key part of that mission. If elected,
    I will advocate for equitable access to the arts, adequate funding, and strong
    community partnerships so every student can benefit from the transformative power
    of the arts.

    and fund programs for those opportunities. Being able to facilitate the provision
    of those is very important to me. If providing arts/music education gives studends
    the desire to do well in school then we should do everything possible to make
    sure those opportunities are offered.
