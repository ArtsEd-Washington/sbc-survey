    that apply.)
  response1: Music
  question2: Which of these arts did you experience outside the K-12 school day? (Check
    all that apply.)
  response2: Cultural/Folk Arts, Music
  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: |-
    I was a band kid as soon as that option became available, and later I began taking private piano lessons. Music quickly became more than just an extracurricular. It was a way to express myself when words didn’t feel like enough. The arts gave me an outlet to process emotions, communicate in new ways, and connect with others.

    Learning music also taught me discipline and built my work ethic. Practicing an instrument requires patience, consistency, and focus—skills that carried over into my academics and continue to serve me in my professional life. Just as importantly, music broadened my perspective. It deepened my understanding of storytelling in film and theater and showed me the value of creative expression as a universal language.

    These experiences are why I believe arts education is so vital for students today. Not every student thrives in traditional or “conventional” ways of learning or expressing themselves, but the arts give them a pathway to be seen, heard, and successful. The discipline, creativity, and empathy students build through the arts stay with them for life and help them grow into well-rounded adults.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    Olympia has incredible arts programs that showcase the creativity and talent of our students, thanks to dedicated teachers and strong community support. From music and theater to visual arts, these programs give students opportunities to grow in confidence, discipline, and collaboration.

    At the same time, we face challenges that threaten access and equity in the arts. Budget constraints, staffing shortages, and inequities between schools mean not every student has the same opportunity to participate. Too often, the arts are seen as “extras” instead of essential components of a well-rounded education, and that creates gaps in access.

    I want voters to know that I see the arts as vital, not optional. Every student—regardless of which school they attend—deserves the chance to discover their creative voice and the skills the arts build. My perspective is that we need to protect and strengthen arts programming, even in tough budget times, by prioritizing equitable access and seeking creative partnerships with our community to sustain these opportunities for all students.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education is not separate from my vision for our schools—it’s woven into it. My campaign is about inclusivity, accessibility, accountability, and transparency, and the arts play a critical role in all of those areas. The arts invite every student to participate and succeed in different ways, regardless of background or learning style. They build bridges across differences, create opportunities for collaboration, and help students develop the creativity and resilience they’ll need in life beyond the classroom.

    Supporting arts education means making sure every student, in every school, has access to these opportunities—not just those in well-resourced programs or families who can afford private lessons. It also means listening to our educators and community partners about what resources and support they need to keep the arts strong in Olympia.

    For me, protecting and strengthening arts education isn’t just about defending “programs.” It’s about ensuring that every student has the chance to discover their own voice, build confidence, and connect to something larger than themselves. By giving students these opportunities now, we’re preparing them to be successful, creative, and engaged members of our community long after they leave the classroom.

    taught me discipline, teamwork, and the value of consistent practice. Theatre
    helped me appreciate the importance of storytelling and empathy. Visual arts allowed
    me to explore creativity and problem-solving from a more personal, reflective
    space. Together, these experiences made me a more well-rounded learner and helped
    me develop strong communication and leadership skills. After high school, the
    lessons I learned from the arts continue to influence how I approach challenges,
    with creativity, resilience, and an appreciation for diverse forms of expression.

  response5:
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting

  response6: Arts education aligns closely with my overall vision of empowering educators
    and valuing their professional expertise. I believe teachers are the heart of
    innovation in our schools, and supporting them through high-quality professional
    development, especially around integrating the arts across content areas, can
    enhance engagement and deepen learning for all students. My campaign emphasizes
    collaboration and creativity, which are core values of arts education. Finally,
    I believe in strengthening partnerships with community organizations, local artists,
    and cultural institutions to create a vibrant, well-rounded educational experience.
    By investing in the arts and the educators who bring them to life, we empower
    students to think critically, express themselves, and thrive in an ever-changing
    world.

  response3: The arts had a lasting impact on my education and my life. In high school,
    choir taught me the importance of teamwork and listening, skills I use every day
    as a business owner and parent. Ceramics class gave me a creative outlet and a
    lifelong appreciation for hands-on learning, and it’s also where I met my wife,
    so it’s safe to say the arts changed my life in more ways than one. Those experiences
    remind me how essential the arts are for helping students find confidence, connection,
    and creativity. As a school board member, I want to ensure every student in Olympia
    has the same opportunities to discover their passions through the arts

  response5: |-
    Olympia has a proud tradition of supporting the arts, from strong music and theater programs to dedicated teachers who inspire creativity in our students. That’s a real strength of our district, and it reflects our community’s values. At the same time, we know access and equity can vary from school to school, and budget pressures too often put arts programs on the chopping block.

    As a parent and business owner, I’ve seen how creativity and collaboration, the very skills fostered by the arts, are essential for success in life and work. Every student deserves the opportunity to explore music, visual arts, and performance. I’ll advocate for maintaining and expanding arts opportunities, ensuring that creativity remains a cornerstone of an Olympia education.
