  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: I participated in band programs in public school from the time I was
    in fifth grade until I graduated. These programs gave me a reason to come back
    to school every day. I developed friendships, increased my self-confidence, and
    gained access to scholarships and academic opportunities through the band programs
    in my district. Additionally, band programs increased my sense of belonging in
    my teenage world where I didn't feel I belonged anywhere else. I attribute my
    academic success to music programs that acknowledged who I was authentically more
    than anywhere else in my community as a youth.
