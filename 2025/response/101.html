  response3: 'For a painfully shy non-athletic teen, the arts gave me a sense of belonging
    and outlet to express myself.  I played trombone in middle and high school, and
    even had the opportunity to tour Europe with an elite student band.  I started
    piano lessons in 3rd grade and performed an hour long memorized senior recital.  I
    still play the piano, which helps me relieve stress and center myself.  '

  response3: 'My experiences in high school theatre and language learning had a profound
    impact on my education and career, as well as becoming a strong supporter of the
    arts as an adult. Performing in numerous theatre productions gave me confidence
    and helped me develop collaboration, communication, and leadership skills that
    carried into college, my professional life, and now my role as a school board
    director. At the same time, my passion for learning Spanish continued through
    college, where I earned a minor in Spanish as a sophomore and used the language
    regularly in my first job after graduation. Both theatre and language learning
    opened doors, strengthened my voice, and shaped the leader I am today.

  response5: |-
    Spokane Public Schools has a rich tradition of arts programming, from music and theatre to visual and digital arts, and these opportunities reach students across grade levels. One of our district’s greatest strengths is the dedication of our educators who bring creativity into classrooms and ensure the arts remain a vibrant part of a well-rounded education.

    However, like many districts, we face challenges in maintaining consistent funding, equitable access, and adequate space for arts instruction, especially as we balance state funding gaps and other program needs. As a board director, I believe the arts are not “extras” but essential for student engagement, self-expression, and academic success. I want voters to know that I support protecting and expanding arts opportunities so that every student, regardless of background, can benefit from the creativity, confidence, and critical thinking that the arts provide.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting

  response6: |
    Arts education has had a profound impact on my own family, which is why it is such an important part of my vision for public schools. My son participated in music from grades 5–12, developing not only strong musical skills and lifelong friendships, but also the analytical and mathematical abilities that often go hand-in-hand with music education and he is now studying mechanical engineering in college. My daughter attended a project-based public high school where she learned the skilled art of stained glass, gaining both material science knowledge and artistic expertise, and now teaches stained glass classes while attending college.

    These experiences demonstrate how arts education enriches students’ academic, social, and personal growth, opening doors to future opportunities. As a school board director running to retain my seat, I am committed to ensuring every student has access to high-quality arts programs that foster creativity, critical thinking, and real-world skills, because the arts truly transform lives.

  response3: |-
    Throughout school, I immersed myself in anything that involved visual arts, from drawing and painting to photography and even playing in the school band (I can argue that this is a visual art, if needed). These experiences weren’t just extracurriculars; they were foundational. The arts taught me to see the world through a lens of innovation and empathy. They helped me understand that every person’s path is unique, and that compassion and creativity are essential for navigating life.

    During high school, I participated in Running Start with a focus on visual and media arts. That program deepened my technical skills and broadened my perspective on how art intersects with communication, culture, and community. Since then, I’ve carried those tools into every aspect of my professional life. Whether it's designing marketing materials, creating visual content, or helping others express their ideas, I continue to be a resource for my community.

    Strengths of Spokane’s Arts Programming

    Dedicated educators and community partnerships: Our district benefits from passionate arts teachers and collaborations with local organizations like Spokane Arts and the MAC, which expand access to performances, exhibitions, and mentorship.

    Student talent and diversity: From visual arts to music and theater, Spokane students consistently showcase creativity that reflects the district’s cultural richness and resilience.

    Integrated arts in some schools: Programs like Ferris High School’s music department and Libby Center’s creative curriculum demonstrate what’s possible when arts are prioritized.

    Challenges We Must Address

    Equity of access: Not all schools have the same resources—some lack full-time arts educators, instruments, or materials. This creates disparities in opportunity, especially for Title I schools.

    Funding instability: Arts programs are often first on the chopping block during budget cuts, despite their proven impact on student engagement, mental health, and academic success.

    Limited representation: Curricula and performances don’t always reflect the diverse cultures and identities of our students. We need more inclusive programming that uplifts marginalized voices.

    What I Want Voters to Know

    I believe arts education is essential—not extracurricular. It’s a core part of how students learn to express themselves, build confidence, and connect across differences. As a candidate for Spokane School Board, I’m committed to:

    Advocating for stable, equitable funding for arts across all schools

    Supporting inclusive curricula that reflect our students’ lived experiences

    Partnering with local artists and organizations to expand access and visibility

    Arts aren’t just enrichment—they’re empowerment. And every student deserves that.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Here’s how arts education fits into that vision:

    It’s a driver of equity. When arts programs are accessible across all schools, not just those with extra funding or parent boosters, we create pathways for expression, confidence, and connection that benefit every student, especially those who may not thrive in traditional academic settings.

    It’s a tool for inclusion. Arts education allows students to explore identity, culture, and lived experience. That’s especially powerful for neurodivergent students, multilingual learners, and those from historically marginalized communities. I want our district’s arts programming to reflect the full spectrum of who our students are.

    It strengthens the community. Whether it’s a school play, a mural project, or a jazz concert, arts events bring families together and build pride in our schools. They’re also opportunities to partner with local artists, cultural organizations, and businesses, something I’ll actively champion as a board member.

    It’s part of whole-child learning. My campaign is rooted in the belief that students deserve more than test scores and rigid metrics. Arts education fosters creativity, emotional intelligence, and collaboration, all essential skills for life beyond graduation.

    Supporting arts education isn’t a side issue; It’s central to how we build joyful, equitable schools. And I’ll advocate for it with the same urgency I bring to academic achievement, mental health, and labor partnerships.

  response3: |-
    I wasn’t especially involved in the arts during school, but I always enjoyed the creative parts of my education — from the dance elements in physical education to the required music classes in elementary school. In middle school, I participated in choir and even took on a leadership role, which helped me grow into a more well-rounded person who continues to appreciate the arts today.

    One experience that really stayed with me was learning tinikling in elementary school. We practiced it every year, though our teacher taught us in 4/4 time instead of the traditional 3/4. I loved it so much that years later, when my own children were in elementary school, I helped them create original acts for the annual variety show — including a tinikling routine with a group of eight kids. We kept the 4/4 rhythm and added moves I had never learned as a child. It became a fun and creative way to share culture, rhythm, and even math through dance — and to bring something original and joyful to our school community.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    Our district is working hard to strengthen student belonging through the EngageIRL initiative, which encourages every student to get involved in clubs, activities, or extracurriculars. The arts play a vital role in that effort — offering creative outlets where students can connect, express themselves, and find community. Even more variety shows!

    We’re fortunate to have many dedicated arts educators who intentionally include and support students with disabilities, helping ensure that every child can experience the joy and confidence that come from participating in the arts. That kind of inclusion is something I deeply value, as a mom of a now adult with autism. We also have an updated K-5 music curriculum that our educators asked for in 2020.

    At the same time, we face real challenges. Some of our elementary schools are so full that art must be taught “on a cart” rather than in a dedicated classroom. This, along with ongoing underfunding of public education, limits what our teachers and students can do. Still, our educators continue to find creative ways to make the arts accessible, and that resilience deserves recognition and support.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: My campaign centers on creating a sense of belonging for students, families,
    and educators. Arts education is an important part of that — for many students,
    it’s where they find their voice and community. The arts also help develop well-rounded
    individuals, and through collaborative creative experiences, students build social-emotional
    skills that support them far beyond the classroom.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: "Arts education was a key part of my K-12 education.  The opportunity
    to take the classes and participate in music helped me develop skills and gain
    appreciate that have made my life richer every day. Music taught me to work hard,
    recover from failure, work in a team, follow directions, and find joy in ensemble.
    High school chorale, band, and theatre were joyous, powerful, challenging experiences
    for me.  \nI started singing in a kid's choir in church and enjoyed band, choir,
    select groups, and solo performance in middle school and high school. I loved
    that my friends and I, under the leadership of a skilled musician/teacher, could
    come together to make incredible music. Individually we practiced to grow our
    skills to improve the ensemble, worked hard to earn a spot in the select groups,
    and even harder to compete in festivals. I was in a select singing group that
    earned a top score at the state competition in 1976. I can still feel the exhilaration
    and joy we felt making incredible music together. My high school experience instilled
    a deep appreciate of music that expanded to the visual and theatre in my adult
    life. Today we support many arts organizations in our community\nMy experience
    in theatre provided an individual challenge where I had to overcome the fear of
    individual performance. I had to face up to not delivering the performance I wanted.
    This  started my journey to deal with the anxiety of public speaking and performance.
    \ The lessons learned have helped me throughout my career."

  response5: "CVSD has excellent arts education programs in music, theatre, and visual
    arts. I fully support these and other extracurricular programs in all grades from
    kindergarten to high school. Extracurriculars are extra, they are essential. For
    students, arts education offers incredible, unique opportunities to grow and gain
    confidence. For our community, the arts offers volunteer opportunities where we
    can share our talents and events where we come together to celebrate our student's
    accomplishments. \nIf elected, I want to ensure that all students are able to

  response6: I am concerned that threatened Federal cuts to education could reduce

    need to fight hard and organize to help our national representatives understand
    we do not support cuts to federal education funds.

    some of our math, PE, and CTE requirements in order to allow a few more electives.
    For example, my daughter took health over the summer, and got a PE credit by playing
    on the tennis team in order to make room for chamber orchestra her junior year.
    Why have athletes required to take PE?  Why have honors/college bound/AP class
    taking students do CTE?  Give us some flexibility. '
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'Arts are great. Spokane honors a student from each high school every
    year in their “Spokane Scholars” awards and along with math, social science, physical
    science, language arts, and foreign language, they honor an arts student.  One
    year, my son’s friend was honored for his talents and hard work as a trumpet player.  Continuing
    our districts support of things like that by passing our levy and keeping arts
    funded is a priority of mine for the school board. '
