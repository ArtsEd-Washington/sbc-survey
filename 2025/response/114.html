    sound learning media all of those things create different opportunities that they
    may have never known without some version of arts.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: Our district offers creative outlets for kids in visual arts, music and
    performance/theater arts. Our challenge seems to be in finding and retaining teachers
    who are well-qualified. We are an underserved district and we are also a rural
    school. Our location poses challenges, finding affordable housing is one of the
    larger hurdles. In spite of the challenges, the district fully supports students
    in their artistic pursuits; they host student art shows periodically throughout
    the year and there is a hallway display case for pottery.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: Arts education is foundational to student success and helps them thrive.
    Art is a therapeutic and creative outlet for kids. Exposure to a wide variety
    of art helps frame cultural understanding and deepens knowledge of history. Art
    as an adjunct therapy can aid students in both personal and intellectual growth.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: Theatre enabled me to draw on practical skills such as self-expression,
    public speaking, emotional intelligence, and teamwork. I also learned an appreciation
    for fine arts and how they contribute to enriching both society and the individual.
    I continued in theatre in college, learning to direct and manage productions,
    as well as all technical aspects in this field.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: "When we first moved to Kitsap, my son had been a Viola player in his
    middle school orchestra. Since funding had been limited, and the teacher’s union
    demanded a four day instruction week, the orchestra program had been cut to time
    with the band teacher. My son soon lost interest and never continued in music
    since there wasn’t a teacher or  program for his interests. \nArts are vital to
    both individual development and societal enrichment. STEM is required for the
    functioning of our society, but arts, when applied responsibly, give us an elevated
    life experience and teach us something about ourselves."
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: While Central Kitsap School District faces more basic issues such as
    low English, Math, and Science proficiency scores, people fail to realize how
    these basic concepts are applied in the Arts. For a large number of students who
    have no drive to enter a STEM career, learning these basics to drive an Arts career
    can be their “why”. To summarize, while my primary concern is fixing the low proficiency
    scores of our students, they need a reason to get there, and I believe a solid
    Arts program can help with that.

  name: Miranda Joy Smallwood
  question1: Which of the following were part of your own K-12 schooling? (Check all
    that apply.)
  response1: Arts-focused Career & Technical Education, Media Arts, Music, Theatre,
    Visual Art
  question2: Which of these arts did you experience outside the K-12 school day? (Check

  response2: Cultural/Folk Arts, Dance
  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: |-
    The arts have shaped both my personal and professional life in profound ways. As an adult, dance and movement have been central to my own social-emotional well-being, giving me healthy outlets for reflection, regulation, and joy. The arts have also provided meaningful ways for me to engage in political and civic participation, helping me connect with my community, celebrate diverse cultures, and build empathy and understanding with my neighbors.
    The arts have consistently supported my mental health and resilience, offering a creative space to process challenges and connect with others in ways words often cannot.
    As an educator and school leader, I have seen firsthand that students engaged in the arts are more successful overall than their peers. Arts education boosts confidence, strengthens academic skills, and deepens engagement in school. When students have access to music, theater, dance, and visual arts, they are more likely to feel connected, express themselves, and thrive both academically and socially.
    For me, the arts are not just enrichment—they are essential. They create stronger individuals and stronger communities, and I believe every student deserves access to them.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    North Kitsap has incredible strengths in the arts, especially at the secondary level. Our high schools have vibrant band, choir, and theater programs that bring students together, showcase their talents, and give our community so much to be proud of. These programs are often where students find their voice, their belonging, and their confidence.
    But we also face real challenges. At the elementary level, arts programming is far too limited. In fact, even the volunteer-led art docent program has been eliminated. This creates inequities in access and leaves too many students without early opportunities to explore their creativity. We also face ongoing budget pressures that too often put arts programs on the chopping block, even though we know that students engaged in the arts are more successful across the board.
    As a candidate, I want voters to know that I see the arts as essential, not optional. Dance, music, visual arts, and theater foster creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. They support student mental health and engagement, and they make schools more joyful and connected places.
    If elected, I will advocate for restoring and expanding elementary arts, protecting our thriving secondary programs, and building stronger community partnerships to enrich what we can offer. The arts are a strength worth protecting and a challenge worth solving—because every child deserves access to them.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education fits directly into my campaign’s vision of joyful leadership, genuine accountability, and community partnership. I believe the arts are not an “extra”—they are essential to developing the whole child. Dance, music, theater, and visual arts give students opportunities to express themselves, connect with others, and build confidence. They also strengthen academics, support mental health, and create schools where students feel they belong.
    My vision is for every child, at every level, to have access to meaningful arts experiences. That means protecting our strong secondary programs, but also restoring and expanding elementary arts so students can discover their creativity early. It means engaging community partners—artists, cultural organizations, and neighbors—to bring even more opportunities into our schools.
    Ultimately, the arts embody what I want for our schools: places where students are known by name, strength, and need, where they thrive academically and socially, and where they are prepared not just for tests, but for life. Supporting the arts is part of supporting equity, opportunity, and joy in learning—and that’s at the heart of my campaign.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    Bremerton School District is fortunate to have up-and-coming arts programs that provide students with opportunities to express themselves and build confidence. These programs bring families together and help showcase the creativity of our students to the community. One strength unique to Bremerton is the way our arts programs reflect the diverse backgrounds and voices of our community. This helps students see themselves as being valued and represented.

    But we also know that at the same time, when the discussion comes around about making cuts to programs (because of budget cuts), it's the arts programs that are often the first areas threatened. This can create inequities in access and limit opportunities for students who may thrive in creative disciplines. I believe the arts are not extras and that they are essential to a well-rounded education. The arts help support academic success, foster problem-solving, and provide healthy outlets for expression.

    If elected to the school board, I would continue to advocate for art programs because of the opportunities that can be provided and to ensure that all students can participate. I want the voters to know that I see the arts as an important part of preparing our students not only for college and careers, but also for meaningful lives as engaged, creative members of our community.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Arts education is an important part of my vision because it embodies what I believe is a place where every student is seen, supported, and given multiple ways to succeed. I understand that there are kids who don't thrive in traditional academics alone and the arts are a way for some kids to discover their voice on stage, their confidence with an instrument, or solving problems by using skills through creative design. I believe when we invest in the arts, we are also investing in the whole child.

    My campaign is also built on equity, opportunity, and community connection. Arts programs are a powerful tool that incorporates all three of these. This can level the playing field by allowing every student, regardless of their background, the chance to explore their creativity. This can strengthen opportunities by helping students build skills that are transferable to any career. And they connect our community, because performances, showcases, and exhibits bring families and neighbors into our schools in a meaningful way.

    Supporting arts education is not separate from the work of academic improvement or student safety—it complements them. Students who are engaged in the arts show stronger attendance, higher graduation rates, and deeper connections to school. That’s the kind of well-rounded success I want for every Bremerton student.

  response5: 'In NK education in the arts such as choir, band and visual arts starts
    in middle school. A weekly music class is the only arts education available at
    the elementary level. Arts education more than one weekly class should begin in
    Kindergarten. '

  response6: 'Art is an additional way to present curriculum and concepts and in a
    way that allows students to access that curriculum. Students learn in many different
    ways. The more diversity used in teacher the greater likelyhood that all students
    will learn the content. Teachers need training on how to incorporate art into
    their teaching. Additionally, instrumental music and dance should be available
    in elementary schools. '

    and the power of practice. I think my early music experiences gave me an appreciation
    of the arts and kept me open to trying new experiences. I sang in my college choir

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: 'Our district decreased arts opportunities for our students a number
    of years ago during some difficult budgeting years. Currently, our elementary
    schools offer music OR art, but typically not both. As I understand it, visual
    art is predominantly embedded in classroom work, at the discretion of the classroom
    teacher. We see continued cuts to arts programs across our high schools. We have
    a passionate cadre of qualified teachers who can, and should be empowered to lead
    a robust arts program K-12. Not one that meets the minimum requirements outlined
    in state legislation, but one that treats arts as the core subject it is. '
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'My campaign centers around the idea that everything we do must be in
    the service of students. The research is clear - arts education improves student
    experience and outcomes. We are foolish not to find a way to rebuild our arts
    offerings for students across K-12. I would like to see dedicated art teachers
    in each of our elementary schools and robust program offerings that continue at
    both of our middle and high schools. It''s not a budgeting issue; it''s a budgeting
    priority issue that we can fix. '
