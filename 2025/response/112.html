  question1: Which of the following were part of your own K-12 schooling? (Check all
    that apply.)
  response1: Music, Theatre
  question2: Which of these arts did you experience outside the K-12 school day? (Check
    all that apply.)
  response2: Dance
  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: As a former home educator, I shared my love of music and theatre with
    my children throughout their learning journey. They started piano lessons when
    they were young and  joined a children’s theater company. The years they spent
    discovering and growing their love for the arts are some of our family’s most
    treasured memories.
  question4: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider implementing?
    (Check all that would you would pursue.)

    Washington's arts requirements in depth to ensure effective implimentation
  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: Battle Ground School District offers programs in music, theatre and visual
    arts, but a double levy failure led to drastic budget cuts that now limit student
    access to choir, art instruction, and supplies. Currently, only one high school
    choir remains, middle school vocal music is discontinued, and art resource gaps
    have widened due to staff reductions, fewer materials, and fewer advanced or inclusive
    opportunities, despite ongoing district art shows and grade-level offerings. I
    believe arts education helps children have a better appreciation of the human
    experience, while creative expression through the arts often leads to improved
    mental wellbeing, social development, and self-awareness.

  response2: Dance, Music
  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: My mom made sure my sister and I had lots of arts exposure from an early
    age. I was very actively involved in high school choir and theatre. I majored
    in theatre in college and spent 22 of my 37 years of teaching career in the theatre
    classroom. I continue to be involved in community theatre and music groups and
    I currently serve on The Broad Strokes Project (bringing murals to the Longview
    community) as secretary/treasurer. I attend arts events regularly and know how
    important the arts are for schools and communities.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: We have incredibly strong arts programs and the district frequently highlights
    them to the community, but sometimes it seems like they are the first programs
    on the chopping block. I think more advocacy for expansion of existing programs
    and education for those making decisions about course offerings might help; having
    been an arts teacher in this district, I have experienced firsthand how life changing
    involvement in the arts can be. By sharing research about the positive impact
    of the arts on students from preK-12, I will be an advocate for inclusion of the
    arts!
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'The arts are part of the core curriculum in Washington state. We have
    incredibly talented educators in this area and students in the arts get opportunities
    to not only be creative thinkers and producers, but also get to work collaboratively,
    stretch and strengthen critical thinking, and focus on process and product in
    unique ways. '

    teacher in an area is certified to teach that subject.  That way, we are sure

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: |-
    The arts played a meaningful role in shaping my creativity, discipline, and cultural perspective. Engaging with music, literature, and visual arts helped me develop critical thinking, empathy, and communication skills that have served me well throughout my education and professional life.

    As a first-generation immigrant, the arts also helped me connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds, which has been invaluable in my work with diverse communities and families. The creativity and collaboration I learned through the arts have strengthened my ability to problem-solve, think innovatively, and build bridges between people—skills that are essential for leadership and public service.

    I believe the arts are not just extracurricular—they are a vital part of a well-rounded education that inspires students to discover their gifts and express their voices.

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: |-
    Kelso School District has a strong foundation of dedicated teachers and talented students in its arts programs. There is clear passion and creativity among our students, and the community shows pride in their performances, shows, and exhibitions.
    However, like many districts, Kelso faces challenges in ensuring equitable access to arts opportunities for all students, especially those from underrepresented or economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Limited resources, funding constraints, and competing academic demands can make it difficult to maintain and expand arts programs at all grade levels.
    I believe the arts are not optional—they are a vital part of a well-rounded education that fosters creativity, confidence, cultural understanding, and emotional well-being. As a board member, I would support:
    Sustaining and expanding funding for arts programs,
    Ensuring access and participation for all students, and
    Building stronger community partnerships to showcase and support the arts.
    I want voters to know that I see the arts as essential, not secondary, and I will advocate for policies that keep them thriving and accessible to every student in Kelso.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: |-
    Absolutely. Arts education fits naturally within my broader vision of safe, strong, and future-ready schools. I believe the arts are not just enrichment—they are essential to developing well-rounded students who can think critically, collaborate, and express themselves with confidence.
    Integrating arts education supports academic achievement, emotional well-being, and cultural understanding, all of which are core to helping students become positive contributors to society.
    As a board member, I would advocate for protecting arts programs from budget cuts, expanding access to underrepresented students, and promoting partnerships with local arts organizations to give students real-world creative opportunities.
    Supporting arts education aligns with my commitment to ensuring that every student in Kelso has the tools—not just to succeed academically, but to thrive as creative, confident, and compassionate individuals.

    we don''t have the resources at the moment to expand the programs. However, we''ve
    done pretty will with what we DO have. Our art and music programs are something
    we''ve worked hard to maintain. We have a large dedicated space in the high school
    to display student art for other student and visitors to the school to see and
    enjoy. '

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: Money is always an issue! The arts are every bit as important as academics
    and sports. They are essential to developing well-rounded individuals. I especially
    appreciate who the Mariachi Bands in our middle school and high school have included
    a segment of our community which previously was less visible. Every kid needs
    to have a skill to bolster self-esteem. For some it's academics, for some it's
    physical prowess, and for others it is artistic expression. We need to nurture
    all of these dimensions of human experience and expression!
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting

  response6: Our community is fortunate to be the home of many artists whose works
    are evident throughout the Long Beach Peninsula. They actively encourage our youth
    to express themselves in all forms of visual, theater, and musical art. We're
    a small community with big talent, and our youth have these artists available
    as mentors and guides.

  response6: I currently volunteer teaching art in a nearby district, Evergreen, that
