  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: Our district's elementary students are primarily served by music teachers,
    classroom teachers, and volunteer docents for their arts instruction. I would
    love to explore offering more instrumental music instruction at the elementary
    level, and incorporating more arts professionals into our staff.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: Arts education isn't just about painting or playing an instrument; it's
    a vital tool for developing creativity and critical thinking. When students engage
    in artistic expression, they learn to solve problems in innovative ways, think
    outside the box, and express themselves confidently. These skills are essential
    for success in all fields, from science and technology to entrepreneurship.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your

  response3: I have a deep appreciation of art. I felt encouraged to explore my own
    interests. I gained the ability to speak to, and in front of, others with confidence.
    I learned to find common ground with people who have different views than mine.

    implimentation, I am unsure what is meant by teaching artist residencies. I cannot
    answer without more information, so I am leaving it blank at this time. I do support
    having guest artist visits.
  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: In the past, we had strong art focus. We participated in programs such
    as Young Authors, Missoula Children’s Theatre and “traveling “ concerts and short
    plays performed at elementary schools by the high school programs. Between Covid
    recovery and the increased credit requirements, there has been a drop off.  I
    would like to see a resurgence. We also struggle to make sure properly endorsed
    teachers are teaching the arts.  It’s cheaper and easier to have the history teacher
    with an art minor teach a period of art, or the librarian at an elementary school
    teacher an art class during library time.
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'I would like to see us put more effort into the arts. After all, the
    A in STEAM stands for Arts. Marching band taught me discipline and teamwork—and
    how not to trip over my own feet. Studies show over and over again what I, myself,
    experienced: Involvement in arts builds community, confidence and a sense of self.
    I would like to see more and diverse art programs implemented in primary grades,
    setting the foundation for building and strengthening the secondary programs.'

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: 'The art''s are not just paint and crayons, there is so much more that
    every student can learn from.  How arts are applied to everyday life is often
    variable and exciting. In today''s society, the use of art is seen on social media,
    as a "side hustle" where people are selling their wares online, as well as various
    art platforms popularized on social media platforms.  The arts are crucial to
    applying STEM in youthful minds because we need to use both sides of our brains!
    There are several studies showing how music helps with memory, where doodling
    helps with understanding concepts and how color can elicit emotions.  The arts
    shouldn''t be electives but part of everyday curriculum. So why can''t we have
    STEMA?  The challenges are within the budgets and the unknown funding factors
    from the State & Federal levels.  '
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'I find it interesting that many public figures, movie stars, musicians,
    artists, may not have finished their high school education let alone college experiences,
    yet some are successful. These artists were able to find their niche in society
    and many have had second careers in other areas of business.  The creativity of
    our society adds value, adds fun & adds happiness. Just like applying math, science,
    language arts and physical activity, music, media arts and visual arts are so
    well imbedded in our culture that we need to continue these areas as equally as
    we center curriculum around STEM to have a well rounded, educated community. '

    all that apply.)
  response2: Music
  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: 'I grew up in a small, rural school district with few opportunities for
    arts education. As I entered college I discovered a whole world of arts outside
    my band and independent music education, and was able to participate in the performing
    arts, visual arts, and creative writing. This has influenced my career path over
    the past 25 as an educator. I see arts education, in any and all of its forms,
    as an essential learning tool that builds brain pathways and exposes students
    to the bigger world of creativity, empathy, and compassion. '

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: "My school district sits in an historically arts-rich community and our
    schools sit in the same zip code as our state acknowledged Creative District.
    Visual arts, music, performing arts, and maker crafts abound in our area. Though
    not all of our local artists are able to provide arts education, many creatives
    give their time, energy and talent abundantly in the community, including partnerships
    with schools. Alongside individual volunteers are a myriad of nonprofits who offer
    opportunities for children and youth to imagine and create.\n\nWith these strength
    come some challenges as well. As schools continue to feel the squeeze of time
    and finances state wide, there is little room an even smaller budget to feed arts
    programs during the school day, and organizations unaffiliated with school districts
    are often tuition based or have a limited number of spots in their programs. As
    a professional teaching artist myself (in a local nonprofit children's theatre),
    I also recognize that some professional artists do not have a background in education,
    or are unable to make a living wage as an educator outside the public school system
    itself. "
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'I want to share my appreciation for offering this survey as a way for
    candidates to express their views about how arts shape childhood, and affect all
    of us as part of school communities. '

    of our community with their time and levy votes to provide those opportunities.

  question3: How did your experiences with the arts impact your education, or your
    life after high school?
  response3: "I enjoyed technical theatre class in high school because it gave me
    an intro into set building, lighting, and technical aspects of theatre production.
    After High School I continued to seek opportunities to engage in the arts, particularly
    in Theatre. I took acting/voice classes in college and performed in a college
    production of the Royal Hunt of The Sun at St. Philip's College. I then went on
    to university at Norfolk State where I took musical history classes which explored
    a wide diaspora of musical influences on culture, including the impact and evolution
    of music in African American culture.  I think arts and music have served as a
    gateway to understanding my culture and history and the culture and history of
    my neighbors, and how our cultures weave together into the vibrant tapestry that
    is America. \n\nBeing raised in San Antonio, TX I was emersed in local Chicano/a
    arts movements from a young age, and have always celebrated the music and culture
    introduced to me by my mother a proud Chicana (Mexican American) who taught the
    beauty of music and art from a young age.   "

  question5: What strengths or challenges are unique to your school district's arts
    programming, and what would you like voters to know about your perspective on
    them?
  response5: 'I do not like the fact that our elementary schools do not have dedicated
    art teachers I believe we need to hire an Art teacher for every elementary school
    and include art in our specialist rotations. While I appreciate the volunteers
    in the art docent programs in our state, we are putting lipstick on the pig that
    is underfunding the arts in our schools. Docents typically volunteer to lead occasional
    lessons or activities, often relying on pre-designed materials and limited time
    with students. In contrast, a dedicated art program led by a certified art educator
    trained in art provides consistent, developmentally appropriate instruction that
    builds artistic skills, fosters creative thinking, and integrates art history,
    technique, and critique into the curriculum. Art programs also allow for deeper
    exploration, student expression, and equitable access to materials and instruction.
    While docents can enrich the learning experience, they cannot replace the depth,
    continuity, and educational rigor of a formal art program. I do appreciate the
    music teachers in our elementary schools who do a great job of teaching our kids
    and even put on small musical productions, but I think we can do more. '
  question6: 'Is there anything else you''d like to share about your vision for supporting
    arts education, or how arts education fits with your campaign as a whole?  '
  response6: 'Comprehensive support for the arts from kindergarten through 12th grade
    is essential to fostering well-rounded, creative, and critically thinking students.
    A robust K–12 arts education includes consistent instruction in visual arts, music,
    theater, and dance, delivered by qualified educators and integrated into the school
    curriculum—not treated as an extracurricular or occasional enrichment. This approach
    nurtures students’ self-expression, cultural awareness, and emotional well-being,
    while also reinforcing skills in collaboration, problem-solving, and communication.
    I will advocate for increased programing in the arts and increased investments
    in enriching our students life through the arts. '
