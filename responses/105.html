How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Merits going back to 1954 of which a school must adhere to is accommodating students to provide them an equal, equitable, fair, and inclusive education/service. I firmly believe we need to open our relationships with senators and district reps to restart legislation to renew charter schools which is the only proven method to help the poorest of our community. Right now most don?t have access to ?choice? to get a further education or seeks resources necessary to them. I know this as a mixed race household and a bilingual household. We need to reach the poorest of our community and from there growth becomes more available.</p>

                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I was not a straight-A student, and struggled to stay motivated in school. My involvement in the music program kept me interested and active in my education, all the way through college. I believe that we should foster and promote extracurricular activities that feed student imagination and keep them interested in school. Since graduation, Iâ€™ve continued to sing with the Yakima Symphony Chorus and enjoy that musical outlet, as well as a sense of community with my fellow Chorus members.</p>
