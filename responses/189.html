</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I can identify  and music classes or projects as the places where I developed my creative problem solving skills that benefit me just about every day of my life. I also remember distinctly the pride and accomplishment I felt seeing my artwork hanging in the hallways or having my poetry judged in state competitions. In high school, the marching band gave me a place to be creative and develop friendships that have lasted for more than 30 years.</p>
</p>
                <p><strong>Research has shown that arts education increases student engagement, helps close opportunity gaps, and reduces drop out rates, yet income, race, and geography continue to be barriers to access to the arts. How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Anacortes has an amazing artist community and teachers dedicated to teaching art to students. However, our elementary art programs are sometimes almost non-existent. This is where fair access begins.
In my job as Director of the Anacortes Arts Festival, we’ve worked closely with the District to bring local artists to classroom, to host theatre performances at the schools and to send students on arts-related field trips. We know it’s not enough. 
Our District desperately needs an elementary art specialist. If our K-5 students have a more robust arts experience, more children will be hungry for the programs offered at the Middle School and High School.
Having taught art lessons to elementary students over the years, I have seen first-hand the students who thrive in those experiences. 
I understand that it is all about funding. I am committed to finding a way to establish an elementary art program and continue to support our middle school and high school to be able to offer classes &amp; programs for more students.</p>

                <p><p>I will push for more art education and or art inclusion curriculum options in our district. A few years ago art options were cut out of the budget. It is a difficult choice, but especially now with students coming back in from Covid restrictions, they need art for many reasons.</p>

                <p><p>I work with the rest of the Board to ensure that arts programs have adequate resources. In particular, Edmonds School District emphasizes the importance of our music programs, and I advocate to maintain the strength of those programs. We have community partners – businesses and foundations – who we work with to provide access to music education for every student who wants it. We also are developing an increasingly strong program in visual arts, and again, I advocate for that and direct resources. I absolutely agree that participation in the arts is a wonderful way to stay engaged in school.</p>

                <p><p>In school I appreciated the arts because I was able to be in the beautiful world I created on a canvas or what ever medium I was using. I was able to take my anxiety and hyperactivity to focus on creating Art that had impact and meaning to me.

Arts have allowed me to express myself in ways when spoken words can?t capture the emotion and sentiment I am feeling.</p>

                <p><p>I think that fair and equitable access is absolutely necessary to ensure that all students are well prepared in their academics especially with regard to arts education. Currently we have art docent programs that need to be made more robust. We need to address fair access by having a better way of assessing where each of our school’s are and re appropriating the funds to accurately reflect the value of the arts for ALL students, not just the socioeconomically privileged ones.</p>

                <p><p>Immensely! I come from a family of artists and musicians. I was certainly one of the arts kids throughout school. My BA is from Evergreen with emphases of student in fine arts, philosophy, and cultural studies. After college, I managed a retail art and framing store for a number of years.

                <p><p>The arts have been central in my ability to enjoy life, express myself and connect with others, and engage in successful academic and professional careers. I know the positive impact access to the arts can have and want these opportunities for my own children and our community. COVID provided opportunities for us to participate in the arts in new, more inclusive ways and we can build on this progress to make the arts more available to everyone. Removing cost barriers through fundraising and community partnerships, expanding on virtual and inclusive access developed during COVID, and enhancing language/translation/interpretation services and diversity are a few ways I believe we can improve. The arts are for and about everyone!</p>

                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>The arts have impacted me greatly in my adult life. I have used and participated in creative endeavors in my work as a classroom teacher, a leadership educator, facilitator, and my connection to the performing arts specifically have led me to my current career as an arts administrator.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>As a board member who drives policy, hires the superintendent, and listens carefully and intentionally to student voice, the board has the power to set the stage for keeping arts and making at the forefront of discussion of whole student learning. On our district, an arts rich part of our Island, we are so lucky as to be able to collaborate deeply and widely with our local artists and makers in authentic ways. Complimentary informal services assist with finding ways for any child to access these opportunities by removing financial or other barriers.</p>
