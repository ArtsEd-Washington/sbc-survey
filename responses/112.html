                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>They created my love for the arts which led to a degree in Music and a career in creative arts.  And now a life time of appreciation that continues today in my interests and time commitments.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I am an advocate for all the Creative Arts in every way I can.  I attend nearly all our CA functions.  I am a donor for fundraisers.  I attend fundraising events long after my kids have graduated.  At the board level I advocate for CA programming and events.  I message my fellow board members and community members when ever I can.  I steward the accomplishments and brag about our CA programs when ever I can.  I volunteer to support CA events.  I went so far to gain my classified certification a few years ago to allow the band director to take an important vacation during a busy time for the band.  I was his substitute for the day and directed the band so he could take a day off.  I’ve mentored students in music.  I fight for funding at the board level for CA even in the stiff winds to curtail funding for these areas.  CA is always at the forefront of my thinking as it relates to board activities.</p>

</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I had rich arts experiences while in school and these are some of my best memories.  While participating in the arts was definitely fun and enriching, I believe that my academic pursuits benefited too. In particular, music contributed to my abilities in mathematical subjects - of course I found out later that they use the same part of the brain.  I have found throughout my life that playing a musical instrument clears and relaxes my mind in a way that helps me be more creative and effective in my professions. I wouldn’t trade these experiences for anything!</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I haven’t seen any statistics that race or income are barriers to accessing the arts within the Washougal School District. Geography (transportation) can potentially be an issue for students who wish to participate in activities that take place after school.  There are many ways this can be addressed to assist students in obtaining transportation to events and practices.</p>
