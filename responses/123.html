                <p><strong>Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Music, Visual Arts, Media</p>
</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I was a child, and I suppose then a teenager, young adult, and now as an adult, interested in both the worlds of math/science and the arts. I entered and won several art contests as a young student, attended various art classes for years at an art institute as a middle schooler on a scholarship, played the trumpet for 8 years in grades 4-12, and even entered college on a design arts scholarship. After high school, I continued to pursue the arts in various forms throughout college (photography, graphic design, drawing, etc.), and have sought out visits to exhibits and performances in all areas. During my brief stint as a Montessori teacher, I taught math, science, and art to 1st and 2nd graders, and even drew weekly cartoons for the students on the white board every Friday. I currently create charcoal sketches and portraits in my free time, and try to find other ways to immerse myself in art in my daily life.</p>

<p>I have chosen to run on a platform of not just STEM, but STEAM education. Art has a place in science, and vice versa.</p>
</p>
                <p><strong>Research has shown that arts education increases student engagement, helps close opportunity gaps, and reduces drop out rates, yet income, race, and geography continue to be barriers to access to the arts. How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Recognizing that our students come from a plethora of cultural and racial backgrounds is one facet to school safety. Creating equitable lesson plans in the arts that are designed with diversity in mind will go a long way in making sure all of our students feel seen and heard. Ignoring the fact that our students are all different in many ways, including economically and racially, would be doing a disservice to those students who come from historically underrepresented communities. Teaching our students to appreciate and embrace ALL differences is not divisive, as some have tried to argue; rather, it creates an environment of understanding and empathy, which is sorely needed in the world today.</p>

<p>Education should be a basic right for all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status or cultural background. Understanding the obstacles students face both in and out of the classroom in paramount to advocating for them and their achievement, and to enacting vital legislation meant to reduce barriers to success. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, for example, was passed to provide support and resources for students experiencing homelessness, while the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ensures that public schools cannot inquire about, and therefore potentially discriminate against, a student’s immigration status. While a lot has been done thus far to try to create an equal and equitable playing field for all students, there is still a lot of work to be done in providing underrepresented students a quality arts education, free from obstacles and burdens. This includes providing support, culturally-sensitive curricula, and effective anti-bullying techniques.</p>

<p>I would love to see more programs offered both in the schools and outside of school hours. Offering programs online would help those students without access to transportation, and offering free or reduced-cost transportation, along with free or reduced-cost art programs, can go far in reaching the most number of students possible.</p>

                <p><p>I went on to minor in Art in College and I’m sure music helped me be more successful in my mathematics education career.  I’ve used art throughout my life as I’ve designed ads and logos for our family business.  I have also done a lot of cake decorating and event planning which I’ve used my artistic skills.  I’ve designed a few houses and done landscape design on my land that my home is on.  Because art played such an important part of my life, all of my children have been involved in the arts in high school as well.</p>

</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>The arts helped me develop my confidence and communication skills. It also inspired my own creative skills with costuming (sewing), building from set constructions, and a general love of creating. As a math teacher, I incorporated visual arts into my presentations and lessons, to improve student interest and understanding. Most of my volunteer work is in the science-fiction/fantasy literacy community, which contributes to visual and performance arts. My graphic design work on programming books and advertisements for this community led to my current career as a technical editor.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I think we need to improve funding to art programs in our elementary schools and provide more support for students who can’t afford instruments and tools necessary to participation. Arts are often seen as extra-curriculars that rely heavily on the fundraising of booster and PTA/PTO groups. I would advocate that we reach out to our community and our local arts organizations to identify community needs that are creating barriers to access. We then need to problem solve to address, decrease, and remove those barriers.</p>

                <p><p>I received a theatre scholarship to Southern Utah University upon graduation from high school.
