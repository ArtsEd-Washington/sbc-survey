                <p><p>Our district is a high poverty district and we are doing everything fiscally possible to expand our outreach to all students and their families.  I believe that equal access to education is fundamental to a successful life after high school and beyond.  While our district is small, we are actively working to create meaningful Career Tech Education courses that well serves our diverse, but small rural community.</p>

                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Arts continues to impact me as I value what I learned and continue to learn as the arts have  taken on different forms with technology.  Music has been a huge part of my familyâ€™s life and its cultivation is what is grounding me even as Arts is often one of the first program deleted from the schools.  Art is needed and necessary even more so now than ever as it helps our students self identified themselves.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>One of the things that I see is that diversity, inclusioness and equity is at the forefront of this program especially in marginalized communities where opportunities are limited or/and not available.  It is important that Art is being used in a culturally responsive setting so that our students are given opportunities to learn about each other through the various medium of art.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>We would first need to assess what the specific barriers are, then effectively address them. For example, if money for an instrument is the challenge, exploring using school funds to acquire instruments that can be loaned, or scholarships for students with need to be able to buy an instrument. Likewise, if transportation is an issue, exploring using supplemental school bus service if practice and/or performance require travel/time beyond what is normally available for students.</p>

                <p><p>Drama was probably had the largest impact. As a firefighter/paramedic and now fire chief, my ability to speak to the public in all settings has helped me a ton. I still use some of the skills that I developed in set design every day.</p>

                <p><p>I donâ€™t really know without understanding why the art programs have suffered so much in recent history. As a kid we usually had a pretty good band, and we put on spring musicals as well as 5 or 6 plays throughout the year.</p>
