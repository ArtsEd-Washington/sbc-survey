                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>It had a profound impact on my values, confidence, love of theater and music. My all time favorite mentor was my theater coach.</p>
</p>
                <p><strong>Research has shown that arts education increases student engagement, helps close opportunity gaps, and reduces drop out rates, yet income, race, and geography continue to be barriers to access to the arts. How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>We have nine different high schools and feeder programs. The challenge for access is robust. Certain schools do exceptionally well with their arts programs. I would emphasize the value of arts in elementary schools and encourage the district to highlight community resources to engage in the arts (symphony, etc.). I would also encourage pursuing grants so students would get excited at an earlier age.</p>
