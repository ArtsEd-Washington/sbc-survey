</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>It was highly impactful giving me confidence and expanding my knowledge especially the media as I was Yearbook editor and music as I played first chair in elementary school.</p>
</p>
                <p><strong>Research has shown that arts education increases student engagement, helps close opportunity gaps, and reduces drop out rates, yet income, race, and geography continue to be barriers to access to the arts. How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I will continue to promote the arts at all levels.  Two years ago we identified one of our elementary schools as the first Academy of the Arts.  It has been very successful and they are excited to come back into the school this year and offer even more activities in each area.  When we see a barrier for even one student, we analyze the best strategy to overcome it and receive access.  As  a board member I supported the creation of that Academy and will continue to support and look for more growth in the arts at each school.  I have always supported the budget for support in the arts.</p>

</p>
                <p><strong>How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?</strong></p>
                <p><p>I found a great group of friends doing music and theater in high school.  It really helped me develop my confidence and my ability to work as part of an ensemble.  This carried over to college, where I also did theater.  I ultimately went to law school, and I feel that my experience in performing arts helped me feel comfortable with the public speaking that required.  In addition, my arts education gave me a broad perspective on history and exposed me to many great works (such as Shakespeare?s plays) that have continued to enrich my life.</p>

How do you see yourself addressing fair access in your district?</strong></p>
                <p><p>Because this is my first time running for school board, I am just becoming acquainted with what the district offers and what the needs are, so I am hesitant to jump in and offer uninformed solutions.  I can say assuredly, however, that this is a very high priority for me and I will advocate strongly for a robust arts program for all students.</p>
