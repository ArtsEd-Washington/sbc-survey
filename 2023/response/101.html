  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'Because my middle school offered Orchestra, I learned the violin, learn
    to read music, and found identity in my teenage years through the music program
    in my high school. I continued to play my violin through college and have taught
    violin for many years. I continue to play in a community orchestra as often as
    possible. The arts programs in our schools are vitally important. They allow children
    to learn new skills, develop talents, and find passion and friends. I strongly
    support music and the arts in our public schools. '
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create
    a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan;
    Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers;
    Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability; Seek out
    insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: Doing an audit of our current programs is a good place to start. We need
    to look at SB5878 and see if there are any criteria that our district is currently
    not meeting and then work with our curriculum and education department to create
    a plan to remedy our short comings. Currently we have had some concern that our
    elementary music classes do not incorporate instruments on a continual basis.
    These are formative years for our children and learning to read music and becoming
    familiar with different musical instruments will give them opportunities to pursue
    those throughout their education. An audit of our programs will put us on a path
    to making sure we are providing all children access to equal musical education.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: 'Music brings people together regardless of any differences we may have.
    Music in our schools builds unity between peers, self-worth, and self-confidence
    in individual students. Building self-confidence and identity will benefit these
    students throughout their formal education and future career paths. The music
    and the arts are a community that has no barriers. When we provide equal opportunity
    for the arts programs in our schools we are building a student body that feels
    connected, feels unified, and gives students higher personal success rates. I
    will always be an advocate for all students in my school district to have equal
    access to music and the arts. '
