  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'I was in theater my entire 4 years in high school.  My teacher, Mr.
    Hyde, became my lifelong friend and mentor.  High school can be challenging for
    many students, and having a teacher that you connect with and a class you feel
    comfortable in can make a huge difference in your life.  The skills I learned
    in drama as far as public speaking and being comfortable with who I am, have served
    me well into my adult life. '

  response5: 'From personal experience, I can say that arts education plays a huge
    role in student success.  I would hope that we are able to provide enough offerings
    and opportunities so that each student may find an art education that they connect
    with, find value and are able to grow and succeed as students.  The providing
    of arts education in our schools is vital to the wellbeing of our students.  '

  response2: |+
    We had a neighborhood charity show about twice a year growing up called 'The Costa Circle Players' and we would put on plays like 'The Music Man', 'West Side Story'  and "The Man from La Mancha'. I still remember being one of the Barbara Shop Quartet guys. I also sang 'Thank Heaven for Little Girls' in front of 1,000 people (all for charity). Being about 9 years old at the time I was not thrilled with that song as I was supposed to do 'I have often walked down this street before' which I liked a whole lot better but when the director changes her mind, the show must go on. Me and my older sisters started doing it when I was about 7, then I continued after they got too old until about 13. I loved it, the rehearsals were long but putting the shows on (we usually did several) were a blast. When you sing a solo in front of 1,000 people you feel you can almost do anything and it gives you confidence for the rest of your life as a public speaker which, being a school board member, will help.

    I also played the trumpet in school but acting was definitely a  character builder.

  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Develop
    or update a district level arts plan; Develop or expand district support for teaching
    artist residencies; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities
    for classroom teachers; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and
    accountability; Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations;
    Attend art classes first hand especially in k-5 since i feel that is where we
    are lacking the most variety.
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: Ensure that we are complying with this bill and all k-8 and 9-12 students
    are meeting the requirement. Also, ensure we have the qualified teachers available
    to meet the requirements of this bill.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Art even more so than sports and music is a great creative outlet for
    kids. Academics is using your brain but these three (Arts, Sports and Music) use
    more of your body where they have to learn to work in symmetry with each other.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: My music education in Evergreen Public Schools formed the foundation
    of a lifetime of involvement in choral music. Life is more joyful because of that
    foundation.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools;
    Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers;
    Support trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts
    teachers; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability;
    Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: "Access to arts and music is currently part of the educational program
    in Evergreen, with music in K-8, and a full spectrum of offerings in high school,
    available for students for over 40 years. Evergreen's board has always supported
    the preservation of arts programs when there are downturns in revenue. \n\nWhile
    I don't anticipate that SB5878 will impose new requirements, I'll ask that the
    superintendent review the State Board of Education rules (once they're as we go
    through the budgeting process"
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: "It continues to play a similar role in education that it played in mine,
    growing up in Evergreen's schools years ago. I loved my years of instrumental
    and vocal music. Music centered me and fostered an ability to face the rest of
    the day. As a young neurodivergent student (decades before those traits were well
    understood) I didn't know how fundamental music education was to succeeding at
    school. Research has since informed us why. Kids who study music and arts do better
    at core academics. \n\nTrauma-informed and culturally responsive practices can
    only improve that offering by fostering interest in more students for their education.
    Learning is exponentiated even more when a student perceives physical, social,
    and emotional safety throughout their day. Evergreen is fortunate to have accomplished
    and dedicated musicians and artists at every level teaching the arts. Improvement
    in these practices must involve everyone in the district. "

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?

    on levy funding and it would be nice if we had this funded by the state.

    Covid shutdown we managed to continue our arts programs. I believe the arts is
    part of a well balanced education. For many of our students it can be the reason
    they come to school every day. We also see the positive results in our students
    academic achievement.

  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I continued my love of the arts through college and still have a love
    for the arts that stemmed from that. I volunteer with arts programs and my own
    9th grader is heavily involved in the HHS theater program after being in Kids
    Who Care production companies in Texas. I think my experiences in the arts shaped
    who I am heavily and helped me to grow and learn in a way that fit my brain. I
    believe all children should be exposed to the arts and given the opportunity to
    fan that flame within them!

    with it and talking about it.

    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period

    any human can have. I know that this will play a role in the connection and growth
    both mentally and emotionally of students in HISD.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I love art!  My favorite medium during my education, was fabricating
    jewelry with metals. I began selling earrings in a leather shop shortly after
    graduating and currently have my own small successful business. It greatly impacts
    my life each time I step into my workshop, bringing great joy along with challenges
    in creating new items. Every student needs to have the opportunity to explore
    art in different forms.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom
    teachers; Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: "Since the school district I would represent as a board member is very
    small, with K-8 teachers each responsible for three grade levels there are unique
    challenges. The high school has a professional who is shared with the grade school,
    doing wonderful visual lessons. The high school has an individual student plan,
    which follows each student, meeting the requirements of the path they develop
    for their educational goals.\nTherefore, I would seek out ways the grade school
    classroom teachers could develop and acquire resources in order to incorporate
    art into their everyday instruction of basic skills.  \nEach student has different
    learning styles, so including color and visual opportunities for them to fulfill
    assignments would tap into these styles."
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: By using trauma-informed and culturally responsive practices, students
    could be allowed to unlock suppressed feelings and experiences in an acceptable
    and advantageous way. Acceptance and a caring school community, will help unblock
    learning and moving ahead at their young age.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: Being a part of the music and theater communities in junior high and
    high school provided me with a sense of family during those formative years. It
    positively benefited my social and emotional health as well as gave me an opportunity
    to learn a new language through the reading of music. I continued to be involved
    with the arts after high school and went on to study dance in college. Post-university
    I continued to dance and was with a local dance company for six years.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: I believe that our district is currently meeting the requirements of
    the policy.  I would support the continuation of the current coursework offerings
    and look for opportunities to increase what we are able to provide to our students.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Creative and artistic expression can have profound impact on how students
    are able to communicate with others and reflect on their own experiences. We all
    have different ways of learning and expressing knowledge. Ensuring that our visual
    and kinetic learners have opportunities to excel and thrive as well will help
    more of our students experience success.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I came to recognize the importance of the arts on each of us individually
    and as a community. As a teacher, a mom and a bonafide child development nerd
    I have learned about the impact that  the arts has on growing our brains, our
    social skills, and our capacity to regulate our emotions.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts

    insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: Our district currently offers arts at all our schools. My biggest concern
    is in our middle and high schools. With so many course requirements, many of our
    students find it difficult to fit an art into their schedule. Reviewing this issue
    and was that we can support students so that they can experience art education
    during their upper grade years would be the first step to assuring true access
    to the arts for all.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: The power of the arts to heal can not be overstated. The research is
    clear that when people, especially children, who have suffered trauma are given
    access to various forms of art they heal more quickly, have better reintegration
    into the community, and lead more fulfilling lives.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: Although I never did consider myself Ã¬artisticÃ® anything art related
    in school was meaningful.  I think theater/drama/dance helped me develop confidence
    in public speaking and poise.  There was also learning about commitment to the
    Ã¬team,Ã® benefits of practicing and exposure to an aspect of culture I may not
    have had otherwise.  It also helped me realize that art, dance, music was not
    my path.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create
    a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan;
    Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Support arts
    inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers; Support
    trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts teachers;
    Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations; I would
    consider any effort to bolster opportunities for our students.  But if art/music/theater;
    etc is considered part of core curriculum and basic education then the State of
    Washington is falling far short of Ã¬ample funding.Ã®
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: I plan to advocate with our legislature to recognize the vast inequity
    in the funding formulas that make it nearly impossible to grow and maintain art/music/theater
    programs in small schools.  Small and rural school rely heavily on the community,
    Band Boosters and levies.  Also, as our district works to rebuild following a
    series of challenging years, our prized music program remains at the forefront
    of conversations.  Recruiting and retaining talented teachers is a priority in
    all areas, but definitely in this area.  Finally I will encourage my board and
    superintendent to make sure these priorities are reflected in the strategic planning
    we are undertaking.  The community and the students are very clear that this is
    a necessary tradition in our district.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Like I said, art, creativity, etc has never been my path, but I have
    seen what it means for kids and adults.  The Arts is at minimum enriching and
    part of a well-rounded education.  But very often it is oneÃ­s identity, their
    voice, their salvation and survival.  Kids in my district are struggling like
    all districts.  In a rural town the healthy outlets and experiences are not Ã¬just
    down the street.Ã®  So itÃ­s critical that  any student who walks through our doors
    is encouraged and supported in finding their creative voice in whatever medium
    that is meaningful to them.
