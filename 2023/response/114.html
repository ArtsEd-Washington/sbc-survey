  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: As an elementary school teacher, I have always been interested in giving
    kids the opportunity to learn about many different mediums of art. Each year we
    would make  puppets and perform puppet shows for our parents. We painted, used
    clay, origami, sculpture, and other arts and crafts. Besides , what I have done
    in the classroom in the past I am currently working into elementary schools to
    help teachers use their art curriculum. Our four children have enjoyed learning
    to dance, play instruments, and have many talents in various fields of art. They
    inturn have taught our grandchildren. These are just a few ways Art education
    has influenced my adult life.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Support
    arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers;
    Support trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts
    teachers; Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability;
    Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations; Our
    native population is very interested in having more art in the schools and will
    help finance the materials.
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: Sb5878 requires a commitment at both the district level, and the classroom
    level. Without additional support to teach art to the teachers, it would be difficult
    to expect them to do all that is asked. Budget cuts often ate felt in the art
    supply room. Principles need to make a commitment to help find additional funds
    if necessary to keep a variety of materials available. I have found that PTAs
    and grants are great ways to finance art projects.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: One way is to have counselors who can utilize drawing when students are
    upset order need to express their emotions. Another way is to offer theater where
    the kids can express themselves. even third graders are capable of writing a script,
    and putting together a puppet show for the younger children on topics of current
    concern. many of the students I work with look forward to a special time with
    the art teacher. They enjoyed learning how to draw, how to paint, and how to express
    themselves with color.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Media Arts, Music, Theatre
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I always wanted to be a band kid or in choir but there weren't enough
    opportunities at the school district I grew up in. At the end of high school I
    was able to be in a play that was part of advocacy outreach for HIV (in the 90's)
    that experience became my community and where I finally had a place to belong
    that wasn't with the kids getting in trouble. It was what I need when I needed
    it

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: My favorite part of that legislation and what will be vital in our district
    is the role that art teachers play in the constructing of our curriculum. If given
    the opportunity I would love to create a task-force or advisory board that is
    let by teachers and includes students and families
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Our district is struggling under the weight of extreme bigotry and racism
    and a top down leadership style where many people are distrustful of those with
    power. I would love to find a way to bring healing to our schools and staff and
    students through the beauty and freedom of art in our world. Hosting opportunities
    for community to create things together would be amazing

  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'I would not be able to run for school board without experience in the
    performance arts. Singing was the only subject in school where I excelled. I loved
    music, and because of it, I loved being at school. Our chorus traveled, competed,
    and gave me lifelong memories and friends. '

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: 'We have a lot of work to do in our district. We have two high schools.
    One with an enrollment of 500 students, another with 1,000. In our smaller high
    school, half of the art programs were eliminated due to shrinking class sizes.
    We need to remedy this immediately by prioritizing spending.  I would work to
    bring back before and after school art classes. '
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: 'Thomas Merton explained it better than I can, "art enables us to lose
    ourselves and find ourselves at the same time." It is essential that we give pathways
    for creative release of emotions, and for students to realize and develop their
    talents. When we over emphasize academic success, we miss all of the athletic
    and artistic geniuses.  '
