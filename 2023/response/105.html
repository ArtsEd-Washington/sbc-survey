  response4: As a lover and supporter of the arts, I wholeheartedly support SB 5878
    and as School Board Director, I will ensure that arts instruction is provided
    in the districtís curriculum. I would look over the bill and compare it to the
    current curriculum and ask questions where I find discrepancies and request that
    we fix the gaps.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive

    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your

  response5: Our world is facing unprecedented challenges albeit division of politics,
    war and social justice, which are compounded by Social Media. Having access to
    express oneself is vital for oneís mental health and expression. Our district
    is equally riddled with gang violence, but having creative outlets will help not
    only with mental health but give students a purpose and will decrease violence,
    absenteeism and will increase retention.
