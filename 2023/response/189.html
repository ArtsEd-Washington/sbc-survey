  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: "I won second prize in an international art contest while in school,
    but I continued with art and music to this day.  I have constantly provided Gothic/Old
    English lettering on countless documents over the years, as well as oil paintings
    for friends and relatives. \n\n Growing up in the vicinity of New York, I was
    fortunate to have been able to avail myself of a 7th-8th grade school program
    which taught the opera and its music prior to actually attending a special  afternoon
    performance of the opera for students by their premier cast at the Metropolitan
    Opera (Cavalleria Rusticana and Il Pagliacci one year and Carmen the next)!   At
    the same time, I have continued to sing with church choirs, as well as the New
    York City Opera Chorus at Wolftrap in the late 1970's and the Pacific Northwest
    Opera Chorus for the last several years.  Music and art have been a major factor
    in my daily life for as long as I can remember, for enjoyment, not wage-earning!

    skills, and a self-image I could respect. It also opened cultural doors to me
    that continue to contribute to my understanding of our heritage even today.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Seek
    out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: I can't know that until I have the opportunity to assess the current
    situation.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: I am cautious of arts education being interjected at times of trauma.
    My impulse to make certain that traumatic events are not appropriated to promote
    agendas among the vulnerable.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I enjoy papercrafting, scrapbooking, and sewing as hobbies. While I don't
    act, I do know how to do hair and makeup for professional photos, and can dress
    accordingly for most any event from black tie to board meetings to sporting events.
    As an event coordinator for our annual local community event, I refer to Friday
    setup and opening as the Dress Rehearsal, Saturday as the Main Event, and Sunday
    as the Debrief and Tear Down. It is very much like putting on a play, with a lot
    of people doing different things behind the scenes, for a common goal that the
    Public sees.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create
    a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan;
    Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers;
    Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: I would start with reviewing what arts programs and classes are offered
    at our grade, middle, and high schools, then cross reference those with student
    pass/fail rates. If fail rates are significantly higher than average, I would
    ask to see teacher evaluations for those teachers along with their certifications.
    From there I would look at the district & building budgets and offer Professional
    Development opportunities (classes) to expand on their knowledge base and learn
    new techniques. I would also look at available supplies to determine if budget
    enhancements for project specific goals could benefit and drive greater student
    success in passing art classes. An example would be; Sultan was incorporated in
    1905, so our Centennial celebration was in 2005. A PAST PRESENT & FUTURE Art Exhibit
    with student art pieces depicting the lives of the original settlers to our region
    in 1905 along with the lives of residents in 2005, and what they think 2105 residents
    lives will look like in key areas of housing, transportation, and fashion.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Art Therapy is a recognized method in helping people understand and recognize
    that struggles are very real and they transcend cultures and time. Through self
    expression, one can connect with their roots through music, dance, photography,
    paintings, digital art, drawing, sketching, film, costumes, acting, speech, and
    poetry. Since art is subjective, learning to love yourself AND accept criticism
    gracefully are skills to be mastered as not everyone will like everything you
    do. Just like the Covid Pandemic, everyone will have an opinion, and some of those
    opinions will be horrible. At the end of the day, how did it make you feel?
