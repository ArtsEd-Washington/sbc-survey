  name: Martin Barron

  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?

    education in your district?

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: As a director I actively encourage and support educational programs,
    including a number of arts programs. My role is not to determine what and how
    but to enable the best qualified people, who I believe to be dedicated, competent
    and well-intentioned, to achieve results that enrich their students. To be honest,
    this survey pushes me to be more alert about this area.

    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your

  response5: I see examples of this, for example in the annual Regional High School
    Art Show at the Wenatchee Museum & Cultural Center. Again I have no expertise
    so see my potential role as being a sympathetic (and empathetic) enabler.

  position: '3'
  name: Tucker Jackson
  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'I was cast in several school plays and it helped me not only overcome
    my fear of performing, but to believe I could make music and dance part of my
    life without being embarrassed. '
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Develop
    or update a district level arts plan; Develop or expand district support for teaching
    artist residencies; Support arts inclusion professional development opportunities
    for classroom teachers; Seek out insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and
    arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: We are currently in a budget crisis in our district and we have had to
    make several difficult staffing cuts. One of the areas hardest hit are the arts.
    I plan to work on passing levy that brings the art teachers back and gives them
    the resources to help students experience the arts. If students canít express
    themselves and donít have opportunities to expand their education outside of core
    subjects they wonít enjoy school as much. I want to make sure we are looking at
    every possible angle to improve attendance and help student thrive in public schools
    rather than just gut it out and get their degree.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: I think giving students access to ways to express themselves and share
    with their peers will give everyone a better sense of the struggles we are all
    going through. That, in turn, will help build community and that is something
    we need more of!
