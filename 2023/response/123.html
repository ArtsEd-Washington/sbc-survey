    sure our district at a minimum is meeting the requirement across all our schools,
    and develop long term/sustainable plans to exceed it.  Art education is essential
    to an inclusive and rich learning experience, so I will also work to give it the
    priority it deserves.

    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period

    district?
  response5: I believe the arts are critical to the education and overall well-being
    of our students.  The arts offer students another way they can develop their minds,
    express themselves, build confidence, and maybe most importantly find community
    and belonging.  They are a key opportunity for our children to explore their potential
    and gives them something positive they can carry throughout their lives at a personal
    level and perhaps professionally.
