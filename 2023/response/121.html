  response5: 'Over the summer I had the opportunity to take a week-long neural education
    course. Understanding how trauma impacts the brain is essential in helping students
    recognize their needs. Art is often overlooked in school, as the subject is not
    considered Core content. More  educators (and administrators - since they tend
    to make most decisions) need to learn the importance of art education and brain
    development.  Students need the arts. '

  name: Gavin Downing

  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: My experience with the arts helped foster my creativity and my love of
    the arts, but it also helped provide new ways of thinking which ultimately helped
    my overall growth and perspective as a human being.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts

    wide range of ideas; provided they can provide evidence of success.
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: We currently have some phenomenal teachers of the arts doing great work
    in the district, but the reality is that all the arts could use more funding and
    support, both in Federal Way and throughout the state.  My approach would be to
    work with the superintendent to assure we find ways to support our amazing teachers,
    while also approaching the legislature to fight for more funding for the arts,
    both in Federal Way and throughout the state.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Arts can help students grow on so many levels, particularly when it's
    culturally responsive and trauma-informed.  I currently work in schools and I
    have seen firsthand how our students are struggling as they return to school following
    Covid, or when students from marginalized communities see their very existence
    politicized in ways that they internalize.  Art helps them grow, explore, resist,
    think, develop, and so much more.  Art makes us human, and it can literally save
    lives when people are at their lowest.  I am a strong believer in the arts being
    linked to student success.

  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'I discovered my creative ability, and learned that it is separate from

  response5: 'Agree, it is of value, and I have been trained in it, but feel that
    it should not be the roll of an Arts program. Anyone needing Art Therapy would
    best be served by a trained therapist, not a general ed Art teacher. Teachers
    need to mot enmesh w their students, as their involvement can be misconstrued. '

  response1: Dance, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'Dance, music and art was my life-line to get through high school. After
    graduation, I continued my studies in dance and music before switching majors
    to business and finance, but I have continued to use my musical skills to teach
    dance, music therapy to autistic children, sing in choirs and performances and
    teach my children the love for music. The arts blessed my life and should be accessible
    to all, and should be seen as priority to reach those students where they feel
    lost or along in the academic or social world. Many children with special needs
    also find joy and respite through art and music. '

    accessible curriculum of the arts to all our schools and that music and art is
    seen not only as fundamental, but as an important partner and aid to help children
    who donÃ­t have those opportunities at home or find solace and safety in their
    art and music expression. '
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: "There is so much scientific research that supports music as being an
    important piece of helping students regulate and focus and make connections while
    listening to or experiencing music and appreciation like they wouldnÃ­t normally
    get. Many students with special needs find that listening to music while reading,
    studying or working on a project, creates connections and helps them regulate
    themselves, finding the beat, rhythm and symphonic complexities to stimulate and
    expand their capabilities and helps them to remember things better. \n\nOur students
    deserve access to good musical and artistic avenues and programs to round out
    their education and the arts should never been seen as secondary or Ã¬nice to have.Ã®"

  response1: Dance, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I am the only working educator in my race and I just started my 29th
    year as an elementary music teacher. I still sing and am married to a visual artist.
    Arts education had a great impact on my life growing up. I wasn't that much of
    an athlete, but you could always find me in the music room or drama room. I was
    the only boy who was invested in speech and drama in high school.

    advocate hard to find other places to cut money.

    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?

    and academically looked at all the benefits of arts education, we would surely

  response1: Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: Engaging in visual art not only enhanced my hand-eye coordination but
    also ignited my creativity and amplified my concentration. Through artistic endeavors,
    I learned to approach the world from diverse perspectives and think on my feet.
    Art became a medium for my self-expression, fostering my communication skills
    and boosting my confidence. Embracing mistakes and coloring outside the lines
    was not just allowed, it was encouraged, teaching me that life itself is an experiment,
    and errors are natural steps toward growth. This mindset instilled in me a strong
    sense of confidence. From a holistic standpoint, these skills have proven invaluable
    in navigating life beyond high school.

    staff training to understand and integrate SB5878 into elementary, middle, and
    high schools. This includes addressing the requirements for equitable access to
    educational opportunities, meeting the unique needs of students, and supporting
    diverse learning styles. Additionally, I hope to establish clear communication
    channels with parents and the community to keep them informed about the changes
    and gather their feedback. Regularly assessing progress and growth will be a key
    part of the plan, allowing the district to make adjustments as needed. The ultimate
    goal is to create an inclusive and responsive educational environment that aligns
    with the principles of SB5878, ensuring all students can thrive.

  response5: In our district, art education has emerged as a vital catalyst for student
    success, uniquely poised to address the challenges of our times. By integrating
    trauma-informed and culturally responsive practices, it serves as a healing and
    empowering force. Art provides a safe space for students to express and process
    their emotions, fostering resilience and emotional well-being. Moreover, it celebrates
    diversity, acknowledging the cultural richness of our community. This inclusive
    approach not only enhances creativity but also fosters a sense of belonging and
    self-worth, thus promoting holistic student development. In these turbulent times,
    the arts are a cornerstone of our students' journey to success.

  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: 'They encouraged me to be more socialized, more involved, and more dedicated.
    In art class I had to practice the same skill over and over to seek improvement.
    In theater and choir I had to memorize lines, notes, position. I had to collaborate

  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: 'While this school yearÃ­s plan has already been approved and is currently
    being implemented, I would work to ensure that for the next school year there
    is a firm plan in place that allows students to take full advantage of arts programs.
    IÃ­m our district we have seen numerous cuts to arts programs, with teachers having
    to travel between several schools to maintain full employment status as the schools
    donÃ­t have robust arts programs at all. In a district such as ours that prides
    itself on diversity and equity, a robust art curriculum and course offering for
    upper grades must be available to all students. '
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: 'Artistic expression is so therapeutic- allowing children the opportunity
    to be able to create free art projects, or sing loud and proud or conquer a new
    song on instrument, or step inside the mind of a character to escape their own
    traumas can be so helpful to students whose only healthy outlet is art and school.
    Having that safe place for self expression and creativity is certainly a pathway
    to healing. '

    creates and enforces policy (not simply a resolution) in accordance with SB5878
    so that children across our district have equitable, robust access to diverse
    arts education. I will also advocate for incorporating arts into academic subjects,
    such as teaching music theory as part of math curriculum.

    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your

    recently started a jazz program for incarcerated youth in collaboration with formerly
    incarcerated local activist and trauma-informed yoga instructor, Faraji Bhakti
    and Seattle non-profit Jazz Night School. Arts education is most critical to and
    can have to greatest positive impact on students with the least amount access
    to it, which is something I will work tirelessly to rectify. Art saves lives.
    I see arts education as one very accessible and important avenue for addressing
    trauma as well as the student mental health crisis.

  response4: In addition to a district-wide assessment of adequacy and availability
    of arts education opportunities and placement of teachers with relevant endorsements,
    and aligning budget and resources to ensuring consistent offerings and access
    across all SPS schools, I would like to explore dual-credit and cross-credit possibilities.
    For example, developing courses that could satisfy requirements in arts and history,
    by learning history through art exploration, and/or increasing opportunities in
    CTE that include the arts. I want to support access to the arts through not just
    adding art classes, but by increasing the ways in which the arts are present in
    all student learning.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive

  response5: Students recovering from pandemic disruption and trauma need the arts
    more than ever. I want to continue to support the arts as not an optional luxury,
    but a critical part of every child's education. The arts offer students an opportunity
    to express themselves, to communicate, to collaborate, to develop skills and interests,
    to learn about the past, and also many wonderful career paths and opportunities.
    Ensuring that all students have access and opportunity in the arts is foundational
    to student success in SPS and is a bridge to the greater community, as well.

  response4: Since art credit is required for high school graducation, all of the

    responsive art curriculum.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period

    district?
  response5: As an LGBTQ+ person I have been engaging in art, as a young adult, in
    the forms of dance, drag, video production and show production for nearly a decade.
    Art is a form of survival for those of us in marginalized communities. Currently,
    my family is invested in art in the form of song and dance as a trauma-informed
    practices with our child. I have lived experience in mulitple ways personally
    around the benefits of art for children and young adults. And I am familiar with
    the evidence-based practices educators utiize to benefit all students. Art and
    creativity are key strategies for student success especially, but not exclusively,
    for students who are BIPOC, engaged in the child welfare system, low-income, living
    with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ students.

  response1: Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: The arts enlightened  me about different opportunities and that ART is
    not just about paintings or drawing.  It includes so much more than what is taught
    in the standard curriculum.  I especially enjoyed the visual arts class in high
    school that taught me how to merge video and audio into presentations, how to
    take and develop photos, as well as introduced me to history behind the technology
    we were using in the classroom.  I think it helped ignite my curiosity about how
    to use visual arts and technology in my personal and professional lives.  Of course,
    my visual art course was in the early 80s and technology has advanced tremendously

  response5: When we talk about inclusive curriculum and schools, art plays a role
    in building whole communities.  Art allows for students to discover different
    talents, develop cultural competencies about culture and communities near and
    far, and seeks to close the cultural misunderstanding and misinformation that
    is the foundation of ethnic and racial discrimination.

  response5: "Every culture has its own unique dance, visual arts, theatre, and musical
    expression. With a renewed focus on culturally responsive instruction, studying
    the unique ways that arts are expressed in different cultures offers an incredible
    insight into the cultural beliefs and values that informed that expression. My
