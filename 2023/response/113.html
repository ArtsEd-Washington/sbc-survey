  name: Julie Balmelli-Powe
  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I'm a farmer and a bookkeeper with a Batchelor's in Science, so I can't
    say my experiences in the arts impacted my life, but I can say they were a welcomed
    balance to my other courses. That being said, had I shown potential in these courses,
    it could have changed my direction. I do believe the arts are important, and support
    having the flexible credits to give students the opportunity to explore other
    paths that they may not have considered or been exposed to.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: To be honest, I am not overly familiar with the arts programs in the
    Chehalis schools. If I have the good fortune to be elected, I will look into this
    further, and will bring ideas for solutions to the board to address any shortcomings
    the school district may have.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: Through life, I have found my mental health benefits when engaging in
    various forms of the arts such as listening to music, dancing to my favorite songs,
    or creating a display or craft project, it helps me cope during stressful times.
    Having personally experienced these benefits, and the balance it brings, will
    allow me to be a better advocate for the importance of arts as an integral part
    in helping a student succeed.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I took every drafting class and woodshop class offered in my high school,
    along with traditional art.  I studied Architecture and Planning, as well as Apparel
    Design and Merchandising while attending college.  Art classes in high school
    provided me with an outlet from stress and anxiety as an adult.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create
    a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan;
    Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Support arts
    inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers; Support
    trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts teachers;
    Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability; Seek out
    insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: Griffin School District has just this year hired a dedicated art teacher.  In
    order to make "art instruction...accessible by all students in a manner that is
    commensurate with other core subject areas," all of our classroom teachers will
    need to be supported by this single art teacher.  Ideally, a curriculum will be
    developed for each grade level that the art teacher will oversee.  It will be
    challenging for our small school, but definitely doable and absolutely necessary,
    whether its required or not!
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: For many students, arts education can have a profound impact on student
    success in several ways.  It provides a safe outlet for students to express their
    emotions.  It can help students develop resilience and coping skills.  Art fosters
    a sense of belonging and positively impacts self-esteem and can reduce stress
    and anxiety.  Culturally responsive arts education helps students understand and
    appreciate diverse perspectives.  At Griffin School District, we aren't able to
    offer our students a lot of elective or extracurricular activities.  Art is a
    necessary addition to our curriculum.

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: As a student who pursued arts throughout my education, I know that it
    had a great impact on helping me develop essential skills that are transferable
    to many parts of my life, such as communication, organization, teamwork, persistence,
    and flexible thinking.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Develop
    or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Support arts inclusion
    professional development opportunities for classroom teachers; Support trauma-informed,
    culturally responsive professional development for arts teachers; I think it's
    important for us in Olympia to work collaboratively with the Inspire Olympia Cultural
    Access program so that we make sure any work they are doing isn't complimentary
    to the programming we're doing in schools rather than duplicative.
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: In Olympia, we're already doing what 5878 calls for and often more. I
    do think the one area we have the most opportunity for growth is in collaborating
    with the arts and music teachers to make sure there is vertical alignment about
    what our districtwide continuum should look like. Since our art/music/PE expansion
    is still relatively new, that hasn't quite happened.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: When we started our family liaison program during COVID, we asked those
    staff members to help us establish an Olympia specific vision for what culturally
    responsive family engagement should look like (with an emphasis on a dual capacity
    model). I hope we can use a similar process to help us formalize that approach
    to arts education. From my own observations during school visits, I would say
    some of the places that are doing that work in really exciting ways are our elementary
    music and art classrooms. Students are learning about a wide variety of musical
    and artistic traditions, exploring world languages, and using artistic expression
    as a vehicle for exploring self--it's quite inspiring.

  name: Leslie Van Leishout
  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Music, Theatre
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: I became an artist and 40 year teacher of theatre. I was a writer on
    the National Core Arts Standards, I was induced into the Educational Theatre Association
    (EdTA) national and state Hall of Fame and won the Golden Apple Award because
    my theatre students nominated me. Art has literally been my life.
  question3: If elected, which of these strategies would you consider to support arts
    education in your district?
  response3: Research current arts program and assess needs throughout the district;
    Work for a budget to finacially support arts instruction at all schools; Create
    a local arts education task-force; Develop or update a district level arts plan;
    Develop or expand district support for teaching artist residencies; Support arts
    inclusion professional development opportunities for classroom teachers; Support
    trauma-informed, culturally responsive professional development for arts teachers;
    Expand district-wide data collection for tracking and accountability; Seek out
    insights from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations; allow arts staff
    to have time to work together professionally
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: "The support of SB5878 requires not only art in high school for the graduation
    credit discussed in this bill but art throughout the educational experience of
    the student. When I taught high school theatre students would say to me, \"I'd
    like to take your class, but I don't know anything about theatre.\" To which I
    would reply \"Is that what you say to your chemistry teacher? I'd like to take
    chemistry, but I don't know anything about it.\" \"No, that is absurd. You expect
    that the chemistry teacher will teach you that art just I will teach you theatre.\"
    Students need be exposed to art from a young age just as they are science, math,
    and reading. The difference is that a child may go their whole life at home and
    in school never hearing a concert, seeing a play, browsing in a museum, or attending
    \ to the ballet. It is critical that the schools help students open this door
    to themselves as artists.\nThe Arts are a Core Subject by federal and state law.
    Let's start treating them that way. "
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: 'It is vital that students be part of social justice to feel themselves
    within the art. It is the most important thing we can do in education is allow
    students a voice to speak to their feelings, worries, experiences, and to give
    flight to how they see the future. This is possible every single day. For 20 years
    I taught theatre where each year students wrote, directed, acted, danced and sung
    new works that they created in and outside the classroom. They spoke of their
    trauma, their lives, their needs, their cultural experience by putting it on stage
    for all to see. This was the best work I did as teacher whether it is the young
    girl who taught seven others to do traditional Thai dancing none of whom were
    Thai as she was, the 9th grader who wrote a play about a boy coming of age and
    attempting to hide his homosexual feelings, or the group of ten students who put
    rap music to skater moves on stage while a narrator pronounced a slam poem. These
    students put everything in their being into their art and it was critical to listen
    to them. Let''s allow each student a clear and unrestrained voice through the
    arts. '

  question1: Which of these arts did you have as a part of your own K-12 education?
  response1: Dance, Media Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Art
  question2: How did the arts impact your education and life after high school?
  response2: "My life has been 100% impacted by Art! \nI was always creating art or
    in some form of art class for as long as I can remember. I was also a visual art
    teachers assistant in high school. \nAfter high school I went to the Evergreen
    State College where I received my Bachelor of Arts Degree with a focus on fine
    arts, cultural arts and art history. \nAfter college I learned AutoCAD drafting
    and became a land survey drafter, drawing property maps and other forms of computer
    aided drafting. Today, I am still involved in land surveys, consistently creating
    visual art and I am very involved in dance, music and promoting the arts in my
    community."

    from local PTAs, Booster Clubs, and arts organizations
  question4: How do you plan to support and implement SB5878 this school year?
  response4: At a time when many districts are coming up short on funding and deciding
    that they should cut Arts programs to save on funds, I do not consider that as
    an option and I am happy to see thatSB5878 is making Arts a graduation requirement.
    The district I am going to be serving is only K-8 and I would definitely like
    to make sure that Arts programs, like music and band, continue to be a weekly
    required class or extra curricular activity for students. I would also encourage
    after school Arts programs for students that would like even more Art in their
    lives.
  question5: Arts education which incorporates trauma-informed and culturally responsive
    practices can be uniquely beneficial, especially during this challenging period
    in history. How do you see the arts playing a role in student success in your
    district?
  response5: 'Art in its many forms is a wonderful way for students to express themselves
    and their feelings. It is important for students to have that outlet in order
    to process what they are going through as young people, in a way that is educational
    and meaningful to them at the same time. I believe that communication through
    art is wonderful and encouraging for students to get their ideas out there when
    verbal communication of their ideas can be difficult. '
